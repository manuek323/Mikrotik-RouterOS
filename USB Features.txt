USB Power Reset

USB power reset turns off USB port power for a specified time. It is useful when 3G/LTE modem needs to be restarted but there is no physical access to it.

Available properties:

    duration (time; Default: "3s") - Time interval of how long power is turned off.

For example, turn off USB port power for 10 seconds:
/system routerboard usb power-reset duration=10s 

RouterBoards with multiple USB buses also require a bus specified in order to do a USB power reset.
Available properties:

    duration (time; Default: "3s") - Time interval of how long power is turned off.
    bus (integer; Default: 1) - USB bus where power reset is applied.

RB953GS: The miniPCIe slot closer to Ethernet ports on the RB953GS board is the one which is shared with USB port and has configurable USB port type, its USB bus number is 1. Depending on USB port type the power reset is done on USB port or miniPCIe slot. The other miniPCIe slot closer to SFP slots has independent bus - 2.

RB922UAG: The USB port has an independent bus - 1. The miniPCIe slot has an independent bus - 2.

CCR1072-1G-8S+: The micro USB port has independent bus - 0. The USB Type-A port has independent bus - 1.
USB Port Type

RB912UAG and RB953GS have partially shared USB port and miniPCIe slot. Due to hardware restrictions it is possible to use only one at the time for 3G/LTE modem.

USB Port Mode

RB2011 series, CRS1xx series, and mAP have micro USB port which operates in host mode when USB device is attached through USB OTG cable. Some vendor cables require forced host mode to recognize connected device.

Available properties:

    usb-mode (automatic | force-host; Default: "automatic") - Defines USB port mode.


Warning

On RB2011 and CRS1xx series boards USB devices may not work first time they are plugged in. In such cases power cycle (not reboot) is required.
