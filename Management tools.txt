After successful RouterOS software installation (if it was needed) it is time to access the router for the first time. There are various ways how to connect to it:

    Command Line Interface (CLI) via Telnet, SSH, serial cable or keyboard and monitor if the router has VGA card.
    Web interface (WebFig)
    WinBox configuration utility
    Using mobile utility (MikroTik mobile app)

Normally you connect to the router by IP addresses with any telnet or SSH client software (a simple text-mode telnet client is usually called telnet and is distributed together with almost any OS).

If no IP or MAC connectivity is available, some devices allow connection through a serial port (DB9 or RJ45, depending on the model);

    Accessing devices over serial console
