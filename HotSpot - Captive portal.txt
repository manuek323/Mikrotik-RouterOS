Introduction

The MikroTik HotSpot Gateway provides authentication for clients before access to public networks.

Hotspot (captive portal) - uses web-proxy and it is capable of using only the default routing table, at the moment. Making the PCC(per connection-classifier) not a valid method, due to the, multiple routing tables used.
HotSpot Gateway features:

    different authentication methods of clients, using a local client database on the router, or remote RADIUS server;
    users accounting in a local database on the router, or on remote RADIUS server;
    a walled-garden system, access to some web pages without authorization;
    login page modification, where you can put information about the company;
    automatic and transparent change any IP address of a client to a valid address;
    HotSpot can inform DHCP clients that they are behind a captive portal (RFC7710);

A hotspot can work reliably only when IPv4 is used. Hotspot relies on Firewall NAT rules which currently are not supported for IPv6.
Example
[admin@MikroTik] /ip hotspot> setup 
Select interface to run HotSpot on 

hotspot interface: ether3
Set HotSpot address for interface 

local address of network: 10.5.50.1/24
masquerade network: yes
Set pool for HotSpot addresses 

address pool of network: 10.5.50.2-10.5.50.254

Parameters asked during the setup process
hotspot interface (string; Default: allow)	Interface name on which to run HotSpot. To run HotSpot on a bridge interface, make sure public interfaces are not included in the bridge ports.

masquerade network (yes | no; Default: yes)	Whether to masquerade HotSpot network, when yes rule is added to /ip firewall nat with action=masquerade
address pool of network (string; Default: yes)	Address pool for HotSpot network, which is used to change user IP address to a valid address. Useful if providing network access to mobile clients that are not willing to change their networking settings.
select certificate (none | import-other-certificate; Default: )	Choose SSL certificate, when HTTPS authorization method is required.
ip address of smtp server (IP; Default: 0.0.0.0)	The IP address of the SMTP server, where to redirect HotSpot's network SMTP requests (25 TCP port)
dns servers (IP; Default: 0.0.0.0)	DNS server addresses used for HotSpot clients, configuration taken from /ip dns menu of the HotSpot gateway

password for the user' (string; Default: )	Password for automatically created HotSpot user
IP HotSpot
/ip/hotspot

The menu is designed to manage the HotSpot servers of the router. It is possible to run HotSpot on Ethernet, wireless, VLAN, and bridge interfaces. One HotSpot server is allowed per interface. When HotSpot is configured on the bridge interface, set HotSpot interface as bridge interface, not as bridge port, do not add public interfaces to bridge ports. You can add HotSpot servers manually to the /ip/hotspot menu, but it is advised to run /ip/hotspot/setup, which adds all necessary settings.
name (text)	HotSpot server's name or identifier
address-pool (name/none; default: none)	address space used to change HotSpot client any IP address to a valid address. Useful for providing public network access to mobile clients that are not willing to change their networking settings
idle-timeout (time/none; default: 5m) 	period of inactivity for unauthorized clients. When there is no traffic from this client (literally client computer should be switched off), once the timeout is reached, a user is dropped from the HotSpot host list, its used address becomes available
keepalive-timeout (time/none; default: none)	Value of how long host can stay out of reach to be removed from the HotSpot
login-timeout (time/none; default: none)	Period of time after which if a host hasn't been authorized itself with a system the host entry gets deleted from host table. Loop repeats until the host logs in the system. Enable if there are situations where a host cannot log in after being too long in the host table unauthorized.
interface (name of an interface)	Interface to run HotSpot on
addresses-per-mac (integer/unlimited; default: 2)	Number of IP addresses allowed to be bind with the MAC address, when multiple HotSpot clients connected with one MAC-address

    regular - performs One-to-One NAT according to the rule, translates the address to to-address
    bypassed - performs the translation, but excludes client from login to the HotSpot
    blocked - translation is not performed and packets from a host are dropped

Cookies

The menu contains all cookies sent to the HotSpot clients, which are authorized by cookie method, all the entries are read-only.
/ip/hotspot/cookie


domain (string)	The domain name (if split from the username)
expires-in (time)	How long the cookie is valid
mac-address (MAC)	Client's MAC-address
user (string)	HotSpot username
Using DHCP option to advertise HotSpot URL

Most devices, such as modern smartphones, do some kind of background checking to see if they are behind a captive portal. They do this by requesting a known webpage and comparing the contents of that page, to what they should be. If contents are different, the device assumes there is a login page and creates a popup with this login page.

This does not always happen, as this "known webpage" could be blocked, whitelisted, or not accessible in internal networks. To improve on this mechanism, RFC 7710 was created, allowing the HotSpot to inform all DHCP clients that they are behind a captive-portal device and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet access, regardless of what webpages they do or do not request.

This DHCP option field is enabled automatically, but only if the router has a DNS name configured and has a valid SSL certificate (so that the login page can be accessed over HTTPS). When these requirements are met, a special DHCP option will be sent, containing a link to https://<dns-name-of-hotspot>/api. This link contains information in JSON format, instructing the client device of the captive portal status, and the location of the login page.

Contents of https://<dns-name-of-hotspot>/api are as follows:
{
"captive": $(if logged-in == 'yes')false$(else)true$(endif),
"user-portal-url": "$(link-login-only)",
$(if session-timeout-secs != 0)
"seconds-remaining": $(session-timeout-secs),
$(endif)
$(if remain-bytes-total)
"bytes-remaining": $(remain-bytes-total),
$(endif)
"can-extend-session": true
}

Some devices require venue-info URL as well, so you are free to modify the api.json file to your liking, just like any other hotspot files. It is located in the router files menu. 

Important

If you have set up Hotspot before RouterOS v7.3 when RFC 7710 was implemented, you will have to use "Reset HTML" function, or manually add/edit the api.json file to have the above contents, for Hotspot detection to work.
