Summary

Dot1X is implementation of IEEE 802.1X standard in RouterOS. Main purpose is to provide port-based network access control using EAP over LAN also known as EAPOL. 802.1X consists of a supplicant (client), an authenticator (server) and an authentication server (RADIUS server). Both authenticator and supplicant sides are supported in RouterOS, as well as authentication server when User Manager package is installed. Supported EAP methods for supplicant are EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2.

Feature is not supported on SMIPS devices (hAP lite, hAP lite TC and hAP mini).
Client

Supplicant configuration settings.

Sub-menu: /interface dot1x client
anon-identity (string; Default: )	Identity for outer layer EAP authentication. Used only with eap-ttls and eap-peap methods. If not set, value from identity parameter will be used for outer layer EAP authentication.
client-certificate (string; Default: )	Name of a certificate listed in System/Certificates. Necessary when eap-tls method is used.
comment (string; Default: )	Short description of the entry.
disabled (yes | no; Default: no)	Whether client is enabled or not.
eap-methods (eap-tls | eap-ttls | eap-peap | eap-mschapv2; Default: )	Ordered list of EAP methods used for authentication.
identity (string; Default: )	Supplicant identity used for EAP authentication.
interface (string; Default: )	Name of the interface the client will run on.
password (string; Default: )	Cleartext password for supplicant.


Read only properties
status (authenticated | authenticating | disabled)	Possible statuses:

    authenticated - the client has successfully authenticated;
    authenticated without server - access to the port is granted without communication with server;
    authenticating - the server is reached and authentication process is ongoing;
    connecting - initial stage of the authentication process;
    disabled - the client is disabled;
    error - an internal error has occurred;
    interface is down - the parent interface is not running;
    rejected - the server denied the authentication.

Server

A RouterOS dot1x server acts as an authenticator. An interface where dot1x server is enabled will block all traffic except for EAPOL packets which is used for the authentication. After client is successfully authenticated, the interface will accept all received traffic on the port. If the interface is connected to a shared medium with multiple hosts, the traffic will be accepted from all hosts when at least one client is successfully authenticated. However, it is possible to configure dynamic switch rules to accept only the authenticated user source MAC address and drop all other source MAC addresses. In case of failed authentication, it is possible to accept the traffic with a dedicated port VLAN ID. 

When a dot1x server is created on a bridge port, the bridge should be running (R/M)STP, otherwise EAP packets from the client will not be correctly accepted. Bridge interface is created with protocol-mode=rstp by default. If the bridge port should not send any BPDUs or any received BPDUs should be ignored, use edge=yes configuration on bridge ports. 

Sub-menu: /interface dot1x server
accounting (yes | no; Default: yes)	Whether to send RADIUS accounting requests to authentication server.
auth-timeout (time; Default: 1m)	Total time available for EAP authentication.
auth-types (dot1x | mac-auth; Default: dot1x)	Used authentication type on a server interface. When both options are selected at the same time, the server will prefer dot1x authentication type and only after 3 retrans-timeout periods, the authentication type will fall back to mac-auth. In order for mac-auth authentication type to work, the server interface should receive at least one frame containing a client's device source MAC address.
comment (string; Default: )	Short description of the entry.
disabled (yes | no; Default: no)	Whether server config is enabled or not.
guest-vlan-id (integer: 1..4094; Default: !guest-vlan-id)	Assigned VLAN when end devices does not support dot1x authentication and no mac-auth fall back is configured. The setting will apply after 3 retrans-timeout periods. Once dot1x enabled client is created and successful re-authentication happened, the port is removed from the guest VLAN. This setting is available since RouterOS 7.2 version and has an effect when bridge vlan-filtering is enabled. By default, guest VLAN is disabled.
interface (string; Default: )	Name of the interface or interface list the server will run on.
interim-update (time; Default: 0s)	Interval between scheduled RADIUS Interim-Update messages.
mac-auth-mode (mac-as-username | mac-as-username-and-password; Default: mac-as-username)	Allows to control User-Name and User-Password RADIUS attributes when using MAC authentication.
radius-mac-format (XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX | XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX | XXXXXXXXXXXX | xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx | xxxxxxxxxxxx; Default: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)	Controls how the MAC address of the client is encoded in the User-Name and User-Password attributes when using MAC authentication.
reauth-timeout (time; Default: !reauth-timeout)	Enables server port re-authentication. When enabled with dot1x authentication type, server will try to re-authenticate a client by sending EAP-Request Identity to the client. When enabled with mac-auth authentication type, server will try to re-authenticate client with RADIUS server by using the last seen MAC address. This setting is available since RouterOS 7.2 version. By default, re-authentication is disabled.  
reject-vlan-id (integer: 1..4094; Default: !reject-vlan-id)	Assigned VLAN when authentication failed and a RADIUS server responded with an Access-Reject message. This property will not apply if the RADIUS server is not responding at all, the client authentication will simply timeout and the service will be unavailable. This property only has an effect when bridge vlan-filtering is enabled. By default, reject VLAN is disabled.
retrans-timeout (time; Default: 30s)	Time interval between message re-transmissions if no response is received from supplicant.
server-fail-vlan-id (integer: 1..4094; Default: !server-fail-vlan-id)	Assigned VLAN when RADIUS server is not responding and request timeout has elapsed. This setting is available since RouterOS 7.2 version and has an effect when bridge vlan-filtering is enabled. By default, server-fail VLAN is disabled.

Examples

Below are described the most common configuration examples for dot1x server and client.
RouterOS Authenticator configuration

Start off by adding a new RADIUS client. The authentication server (RADIUS) does not necessary have to be in the same LAN as authenticator, but it must be reachable from the authenticator, so any firewall limitations must be considered.
/radius 
add address=10.1.2.3 secret=radiussecret service=dot1x

 If RADIUS communication is done over public network, it is advised to use RadSec for RADIUS communication. More information: RADIUS

Add new dot1x server instances.
/interface dot1x server
add interface=ether2 interim-update=30s comment=accounted
add interface=ether12 accounting=no comment=notaccounted
Port based VLAN ID assignment

It is possible to assign an authenticated interface to a specific VLAN ID using bridge VLAN filtering. This can be done using RADIUS Tunnel-Type, Tunnel-Medium-Type and Tunnel-Private-Group-ID attributes. Note that only devices with hardware offloaded VLAN filtering will be able to do this in switch chip. 

First of all, make sure the interface is added to a bridge which has VLAN filtering enabled.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether12

It is necessary to add static VLAN configuration for tagged VLAN traffic to be sent over ether1 interface.
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 vlan-ids=2
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 vlan-ids=12

With enabled RADIUS debug logs it is possible to see complete RADIUS message packets with all attributes. In our example, Tunnel attributes are received in Access-Accept message from RADIUS server:
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet received Access-Accept with id 64 from 10.1.2.3:1812
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet     Tunnel-Type = 13 
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet     Tunnel-Medium-Type = 6 
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet     Tunnel-Private-Group-ID = "12" 
(..)
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet     User-Name = "dot1x-user" 

The VLAN ID is now present in active session list and untagged ports are added to previously created static VLAN configuration.
/interface dot1x server active print 
 0 interface=ether12 username="dot1x-user" user-mac=00:0C:42:EB:71:F6 session-id="86b00006" vlan=12 

/interface bridge vlan print detail 
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic 
 0 D bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=1 tagged="" untagged="" current-tagged="" current-untagged=bridge1,ether3 

 1   bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=2 tagged=ether1 untagged="" current-tagged=ether1 current-untagged=ether2 

 2   bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=12 tagged=ether1 untagged="" current-tagged=ether1 current-untagged=ether12 
Dynamic switch rule configuration

In some network configurations, additional access rules are needed for a particular supplicant to restrict or allow certain network services. This can be done using a Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attribute, please see the RADIUS vendor dictionary. When a client is successfully authenticated by an authentication server, the server can pass back the Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attribute. Based on the received information, the authenticator will create dynamic access rules on a switch port where the client resides. These rules will be active as long as the client session is active and the interface is running. There are certain order and restrictions regarding correct switch rule implementation:

    The mac-protocol, src-mac-address (available only since RouterOS 7.2 version), src-address (IPv4/mask, available only since RouterOS 7.2 version), dst-address (IPv4/mask), protocol (IPv4) src-port (L4, available only since RouterOS 7.2 version), dst-port (L4) conditional parameters are supported
    Hexadecimal or decimal representation can be used for mac-protocol and protocol parameters (e.g. protocol 17 or protocol 0x11)
    The src-port and dst-port support single or range values (e.g. src-port 10 or src-port 10-20)
    The src-mac-address support "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" or "xxxxxxxxxxxx" formats, and switch rule without any source MAC address can be set with "none" keyword (e.g. src-mac-address none)
    The src-mac-address (if not already set by the attribute), switch and ports conditional parametrs are automatically set for each rule
    Each rule should end with an action property, supported values are either drop or allow. If no action property is set, the default allow value will be used.
    Multiple rules are supported for a single supplicant and they must be separated by a comma ","

Below are some examples of Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attributes and dynamic switch rules they create:
# Drop ARP frames (EtherType: 0x0806 or 2054)
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "mac-protocol 2054 action drop"

/interface ethernet switch rule print

# Allow UDP (IP protocol: 0x11 or 17) destination port 100 and drop all other packets
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "protocol 17 dst-port 100 action allow, action drop"

/interface ethernet switch rule print

# Allow only authenticated source MAC address, drop all other packets
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "action allow, src-mac-address none action drop"

/interface ethernet switch rule print 
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; D - dynamic 
 0  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether1 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:01:6D:EB/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no 

 1  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether1 copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no new-dst-ports="" 


In our example, Supplicant2 on ether2 is only allowed to access the 192.168.50.0/24 network with UDP destination port 50, all other traffic should be dropped. First, make sure that hardware offloading is working on bridge ports, otherwise switch rules might not work properly.
/interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload

With enabled RADIUS debug logs it is possible to see complete RADIUS message packets with all attributes. In our example, Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attribute is received in Access-Accept message from Radius server:
02:35:38 radius,debug,packet received Access-Accept with id 121 from 10.1.2.3:1812 
(..)
02:35:38 radius,debug,packet     MT-Switching-Filter = "mac-protocol 2048 dst-address 192.168.50.0/24 dst-port 50 protocol 17 action allow,action drop"


The dynamic switch rules are now present under the switch menu:
/interface ethernet switch rule print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic 
 0  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether2 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:11:22:33/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF mac-protocol=ip dst-address=192.168.50.0/24 protocol=udp dst-port=50 copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no 

 1  D ;;; dot1x dynamic
      switch=switch1 ports=ether2 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:11:22:33/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no new-dst-ports="" 

Dynamic switch rules will only apply to RouterBoards with switch rule support - CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, CCR2116, CCR2216, and devices with QCA8337, Atheros8327 and Atheros8316 switch chips. CRS1xx/2xx series switches do no support this functionality. Take into consideration the maximum number of rules for each device, see CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116, CCR2216 table and basic switch chip table
RouterOS Supplicant configuration

CA certificates are required for eap-tls, eap-ttls and eap-peap authentication methods. Additionally a client certificate is required for eap-tls method. For this example we have already imported a P12 certificate bundle with self signed client and CA certificates. For more information how to import certificates in RouterOS, please visit System/Certificates.
/certificate print 
Flags: K - private-key, L - crl, C - smart-card-key, A - authority, I - issued, R - revoked, E - expired, T - trusted 
 #         NAME                                            COMMON-NAME                                         SUBJECT-ALT-NAME                             FINGERPRINT                                        
 0 K  A  T dot1x-client                                    ez_dot1x-client                                     IP:10.1.2.34
 1  L A  T dot1x CA                                        ca            

Simply add a new dot1x client instance that will initiate authentication process.
/interface dot1x client
add anon-identity=anonymous client-certificate=dot1x-client eap-methods=eap-tls identity=dot1x-user interface=ether1 password=dot1xtest

If authentication was successful, the interface should have status authenticated.
/interface dot1x client print 
Flags: I - inactive, X - disabled 
 0   interface=ether1 eap-methods=eap-peap identity="dot1x-user" password="dot1xtest" anon-identity="anonymous" client-certificate=dot1x-client status="authenticated"
