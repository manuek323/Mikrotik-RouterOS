Introduction

Many MikroTik devices come with built-in switch chips that usually have an option to do VLAN switching on a hardware level, this means that you can achieve wire-speed performance using VLANs if a proper configuration method is used. The configuration method changes across different models, this guide will focus on setting up a basic trunk/access port with a management port from the trunk port using different devices with the right configuration to achieve the best performance and to fully utilize the available hardware components.

RTL8367, 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190, MT7621, MT7531, EN7562CT switch chips can use HW offloaded vlan-filtering since RouterOS v7.

 Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-all or admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.

Not all devices with a switch chip are capable of VLAN switching on a hardware level, check the supported features for each switch chip, the compatibility table can be found here. If a device has VLAN table support, then it is capable of VLAN switching using the built-in switch chip. You can check the device's switch chip either in the provided link or by using /interface ethernet switch print

On QCA8337 and Atheros8327 switch chips, a default vlan-header=leave-as-is property should be used. The switch chip will determine which ports are access ports by using the default-vlan-id property. The default-vlan-id should only be used on access/hybrid ports to specify which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to.

This type of configuration should be used on RouterBOARD series devices, this includes RB4xx, RB9xx, RB2011, RB3011, hAP, hEX, cAP, and other devices.

By default, the bridge interface is configured with protocol-mode set to rstp. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the Bridge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.

For devices that have multiple switch chips (for example, RB2011, RB3011, RB1100), each switch chip is only able to switch VLAN traffic between ports that are on the same switch chip, VLAN filtering will not work on a hardware level between ports that are on different switch chips, this means you should not add all ports to a single bridge if you are intending to use VLAN filtering using the switch chip, VLANs between switch chips will not get filtered. You can connect a single cable between both switch chips to work around this hardware limitation, another option is to use Bridge VLAN Filtering, but it disables hardware offloading (and lowers the total throughput).
Other devices without a built-in switch chip

It is possible to do VLAN filtering using the CPU, there are multiple ways to do it, but it is highly recommended to use bridge VLAN filtering.
