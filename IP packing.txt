Overview

IP Packing provides packet packaging service on network links. It allows simple packet aggregation into larger packets and compression of the contents of packets.
Requirements

Packet packing is part of the system package and has to have a discovery protocol enabled on an interface.
Configuration
 /ip packing

It required to have a configuration in two places, both routers should be set up symmetrically:

    /ip packing - to enable packet aggregation and/or compression on an interface
    /ip neighbor discovery- to enable discovery protocol on the interface

Packing configuration
aggregated-size (20 .. 16384 default:1500)	size of an aggregated packet that packing will try to achieve before sending a packet over the network
disabled (yes|no)	state of packing rule, if a value is yes it will be ignored and will not be part of the active configuration
interface (interface name)	packing will try to aggregate and/or compress packets from this interface
packing (simple|compress-all|compress-headers|none)	the action it should perform when a packet is leaving the interface packing rule is configured:

    simple - do just aggregate packets
    compress-all - do aggregation and attempt to compress headers and payload of a packet
    compress-headers - do aggregation and attempt to compress headers and leave the payload of a packet as is
    none - send packets as is

unpacking (simple|compress-all|compress-headers|none)	the action should be performed when a packet is received on the interface packing rule is configured on:

    simple - unpack received packets from aggregated packets received from the interface
    compress-all - unpack aggregated packet and uncompress headers and payload of a packet
    compress-headers - unpack aggregated packets and decompress headers of a packet
    none - do nothing with a received packet

The router should be seen as a neighbor of the router over the interface you want to enable packing on. If in the neighbor list there is no entry indicating packing, packing is not working!

Packing may increase latency on the link it is configured on.
Example

Router-A and Router-B are connected with cable with interface ether1 on Router-A and ether3 on Router-B. This example will aggregate packets coming from Router-A, but will leave packets from Router-B intact On Router-A:

Make sure discovery is enabled:
 /ip neighbor discovery set ether1 discover=yes 

Add packing rule for the interface:
 /ip packing add interface=ether1 aggregated-size=1500 packing=simple unpacking=none 

On Router-B:

Make sure discovery is enabled:
 /ip neighbor discovery set ether3 discover=yes 

Add packing rule for the interface:
 /ip packing add interface=ether3 aggregated-size=1500 packing=none unpacking=simple
