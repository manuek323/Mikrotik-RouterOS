Summary

Controller Bridge (CB) and Port Extender (PE) is an IEEE 802.1BR standard implementation in RouterOS for CRS3xx series switches. It allows virtually extending the CB ports with a PE device and manage these extended interfaces from a single controlling device. Such configuration provides a simplified network topology, flexibility, increased port density and ease of manageability. An example of Controller Bridge and Port Extender topology can be seen below.

The Controller Bridge establishes communication with the Port Extender through a cascade port. Similarly, the Port Extender will communicate with the Controller Bridge only through an upstream port. On a PE device, control ports must be configured and only one port (closest to the CB) will act as an upstream port, other control ports can act as a backup for upstream port or even cascade port for switches connected in series (e.g. Port Extender 2 and 3 in the image above). Cascade and upstream ports are used to transmit and receive control and network traffic. Extended ports are interfaces that are controlled by the CB device and they are typically connected to the end hosts. Extended ports only transmit and receive network traffic.

Quick setup

In this example, we will create a Controlling Bridge (e.g. a CRS317-1G-16S+ switch) that will connect to a single Port Extender (e.g. a CRS326-24G-2S+ switch) through an SFP+1 interface.

First, configure a bridge with enabled VLAN filtering on a CB device:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes

On the same device, configure a port that is connected to the PE device and will act as cascade port:
/interface bridge port-controller
set bridge=bridge1 cascade-ports=sfp-sfpplus1 switch=switch1

Last, on a PE device, simply configure a control port, which will be selected as an upstream port:
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=sfp-sfpplus1 switch=switch1

Once PE and CB devices are connected, all interfaces that are on the same switch group (except for control ports) will be extended and can be further configured on a CB device. An automatic bridge port configuration will be applied on the CB device which adds all extended ports in a single bridge, this configuration can be modified afterward.

In order to exclude some port from being extended (e.g. for out-of-band management purposes), additionally, configure excluded-ports property.

Make sure not to include the cascade-ports and control-ports in any routing or bridging configurations. These ports are recommended only for a CB and PE usage.
Discovery and control protocols

Before frame forwarding on extended ports is possible, Controlling Bridge and Port Extender must discover each other and exchange with essential information.

CB and PE enabled devices are using a neighbor discovery protocol LLDP with specific Port Extension TLV. This allows CB and PE devices to advertise their support on cascade and control ports.

CB and PE configuration can override the neighbor discovery settings, for example, if a cascade port is not included in a neighbor discovery interface list, the LLDP messages will be still sent.

Once LLDP messages are exchanged between CB and PE, a Control and Status Protocol (CSP) over an Edge Control Protocol (ECP) will initiate. The CSP is used between CB and PE to assert control and receive status information from the associated PE - it assigns unique IDs for extended ports, controls data-path settings (e.g. port VLAN membership) and sends port status information (e.g. interface stats, PoE-out monitoring). The ECP provides a reliable and sequenced frame delivery (encoded with EtherType 0x8940).

The current CB implementation does not support any failover techniques. Once the CB device becomes unavailable, the PE devices will lose all the control and data forwarding rules.
Packet flow

To better understand the underlying principles of Controlling Bridge and Port Extender, a packet walkthrough is provided below:

    An L2 packet is received on the extended port;
    The Port Extender encapsulates the packet with an E-TAG header (EtherType 0x893F) and forwards it through an upstream port, towards the Controller Bridge. An E-TAG packet contains information regarding the PE source port ID. The PE device does not make any local switching decisions;
    The Controller Bridge receives the E-TAG packet and knows exactly which extended interface received it. The CB then internally decapsulates the packet and proceed it through a regular switching decision (host learning, destination address lookup, VLAN filtering, etc.);
    Once a switching decision is made, the CB will again encapsulate the original packet with an E-TAG and send it through a cascade port, towards Port Extender;
        For a single destination packet (unicast), the CB will include the PE destination port ID in the E-TAG and send it through a correct cascade port;
        For a multi-destination packet (broadcast, multicast or unknown-unicast), the CB will include a target group mark and source port ID in the E-TAG and send a single packet replica per every cascade port;
    Once a PE device receives an E-TAG packet on the upstream port, PE decapsulates it and sends the original L2 packet through the extended port;
        For a single destination packet (unicast), the PE will send the packet only to the correct extended port;
        For a multi-destination packet (broadcast, multicast or unknown-unicast), the PE will send a single packet replica per every extended port (except for the source port where the packet was received).

Controller Bridge settings and monitoring

This section describes the Controller Bridge settings and monitoring options. 

Sub-menu: /interface bridge port-controller
bridge (name; Default: none)	The bridge interface where ports will be extended. The CB will only enable when bridge and switch properties are specified, otherwise, it will be in a disabled state.

Port Extender settings

This section describes the Port Extender settings.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge port-extender
control-ports (interfaces; Default: none)	Interfaces that will either connect to the CB (upstream port) or connect other PE devices in series (cascade port). A bonding interface with 802.3ad or balance-xor mode is also supported.
excluded-ports (interfaces; Default: none)	Interfaces that will not be extended.
switch (name; Default: none)	The switch that will act as the extender and ensure the control and network traffic. The PE will only enable when this property is specified, otherwise, it will be in a disabled state.
Configuration examples

Below are described the most common configuration examples. For CB and PE configuration to work properly, a bridge VLAN filtering needs to be enabled, so make sure to understand the filtering principles first - bridge VLAN filtering, bridge VLAN table.
Basic CB and PE configuration

In this example, a CRS317-1G-16S+ device is used as a Controller Bridge and CRS328-24P-4S+ as a Port Extender, see the connection scheme below.

First, configure the CB device. This can be done by adding a bridge interface with enabled VLAN filtering. Additionally, add any local interfaces to the same bridge, it allows to forward traffic between any local interfaces and extended interfaces. In this example, an sfp-sfpplus2 interface is added.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus2

To enable CB, specify the bridge, switch and at least one cascade port. Make sure that cascade ports are not included in the bridge or routing configurations. These ports are recommended only for a CB and PE usage.
/interface bridge port-controller
set bridge=bridge1 cascade-ports=sfp-sfpplus1 switch=switch1

To enable PE, configure control ports and switch. Additionally, configure one or multiple interfaces that should not be extended with excluded-ports property (e.g. for out-of-band management purposes). In this example, all switch ports will be extended.
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=sfp-sfpplus4 switch=switch1

Once PE and CB devices finish the discovery and start the Control and Status Protocol (CSP), the RouterOS will permanently create new interfaces and add them into bridge on the CB device. Interfaces are named by the automatically assigned PE device name, plus the default interface name, these interface names can be modified afterwards. Note that control and excluded ports will be also displayed into the interface list, but they are not included into the bridge.

Now the CRS317-1G-16S+ device has extended its ports using the CRS328-24P-4S+ device and packet forwarding can be done between all bridged ports. 
Trunk and Access ports

In this example, untagged (access) and tagged (trunk) port configuration will be created on the Controller Bridge device, see the network diagram below.

First, configure the CB and PE devices, the configuration is identical to the previous example. Use this configuration for CB device.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus2
/interface bridge port-controller
set bridge=bridge1 cascade-ports=sfp-sfpplus1 switch=switch1

Use this configuration for PE device.
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=sfp-sfpplus4 switch=switch1

After extended ports are successfully created and added to the bridge on the CB device, we can start configuring VLAN related properties. First, configure access ports to their respective VLAN ID using a pvid property. Use a print command in "/interface bridge port" menu to find out the exact interface name.
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=pe1-ether1] pvid=10
set [find interface=pe1-ether2] pvid=20
set [find interface=pe1-ether3] pvid=30

Then add bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged, untagged ports. Note that there are two tagged ports - local port named sfp-sfpplus2 and extended port named pe1-sfpplus1.
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=pe1-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2 untagged=pe1-ether1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=pe1-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2 untagged=pe1-ether2 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=pe1-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2 untagged=pe1-ether3 vlan-ids=30

At this point VLANs are configured and devices should be able to communicate through the ports. However, it is recommended to go even a step further and apply some additional filtering options. Enable port ingress-filtering on local bridge ports and use frame filtering based on the packet type with frame-types setting.
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=pe1-ether1] frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=pe1-ether2] frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=pe1-ether3] frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=pe1-sfpplus1] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
set [find interface=sfp-sfpplus2] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged ingress-filtering=yes

Port ingress VLAN filtering is not supported on extended ports.
Cascading multiple Port Extenders and using bonding interface

In this example, two PE devices (CRS328-24P-4S+ and CRS326-24G-2S+) will be added to the CB (CRS317-1G-16S+). To increase throughput for upstream and cascade ports, bonding interfaces will be created. See the network diagram below.

The CB and PE configuration is similar to the first example, the main difference is the bonding interface usage. First, configure the CB device - create a bonding interface for cascade port, create a bridge and add any needed local bridge ports, last enable the CB. Use the following commands:
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus3
/interface bridge port-controller
set bridge=bridge1 cascade-ports=bond1 switch=switch1

Then configure the Port Extender 1 device. This device needs two bonding interfaces - the first one will be used as an upstream port and the second one will be a cascade port for the Port Extender 2 device. Additionally, configure one or multiple interfaces that should not be extended with excluded-ports property (e.g. for out-of-band management purposes). In this example, all switch ports will be extended.
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
add mode=802.3ad name=bond2 slaves=sfp-sfpplus3,sfp-sfpplus4
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=bond1,bond2 switch=switch1

Last, configure the Port Extender 2 device - create a bonding interface and enable PE. Additionally, configure one or multiple excluded-ports if necessary. In this example, all switch ports will be extended.
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=bond1 switch=switch1

Now the CRS317-1G-16S+ device has extended its ports with additional 48 Gigabit Ethernet ports and packet forwarding can be achieved between all bridged ports.

Use the monitor command in the device menu to see the PE device connection path. Also, use print command in the port menu to see which PE interfaces are used as upstream and cascade ports.

Configuration modification and removal

In certain situations, CB and PE device configuration needs to be adjusted (e.g. PE device needs new control ports) or removed completely. To modify the PE device configuration, all related PE device configuration should be removed from the CB device first. Only then the new configuration can be applied.

First, to remove PE configuration from CB, disable the PE using the following command: 
/interface bridge port-extender set switch=none control-ports="" excluded-ports=""

Then, on the CB device, remove the related bridge and other RouterOS configuration where PE interfaces were used (e.g. see the export from "/interface bridge port" and "/interface bridge vlan" menus). For example, to remove all bridge ports from a specific PE device, use the command below:
/interface bridge port remove [find interface~"pe1"]

Once the configuration is removed, PE can be removed from the CB device list. This command will also automatically remove all the PE device interfaces from the CB interface list. In case some PE interface configuration is still applied on the CB, it will not be valid anymore. Use print command to find out the PE device name.
/interface bridge port-controller device remove [find name=pe1]

Summary

Basic use cases and configuration examples for Cloud Router Switch features.

This article applies to CRS1xx and CRS2xx series switches and not to CRS3xx series switches. For CRS3xx series devices read the CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 manual.
Port switching

To set up port switching on CRS1xx/2xx series switches, check the Bridge Hardware Offloading page.

It is possible to create multiple isolated switch groups by using multiple bridges with enabled hardware offloading, this is possible only on CRS1xx/2xx series switches. For more complex setups (for example, VLAN filtering) you should use the port isolation feature instead.
Management access configuration

In general, switches are only supposed to forward packets by using the built-in switch chip, but not allow access to the device itself for security reasons. It is possible to use the device's serial port for management access, but in most cases, such an access method is not desired and access using an IP address is more suitable. In such cases, you will need to configure management access.

In all types of management access it is assumed that ports must be switched together, use the following commands to switch together the required ports:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes

You should also assign an IP address to the bridge interface so the device is reachable using an IP address (the device is also reachable using a MAC address):
/ip address
add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=bridge1
Untagged

If invalid VLAN filtering is not enabled, management access to the device using tagged or untagged (VLAN 0) traffic is already allowed from any port, though this is not a good practice, this can cause security issues and can cause the device's CPU to be overloaded in certain situations (most commonly with a broadcast type of traffic).

If you intend to use invalid VLAN filtering (which you should), then ports, from which you are going to access the switch, must be added to the VLAN table for untagged (VLAN 0) traffic, for example, in case you want to access the switch from ether2:
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add vlan-id=0 ports=ether2,switch1-cpu  
Tagged

Allowing only tagged traffic to have management access to the device through a specific port is a much better practice. For example, to allow only VLAN99 to access the device through ether2 you should first add an entry to the VLAN table, which will allow the selected port and the CPU port (switch1-cpu) to forward the selected VLAN ID, therefore allowing management access:
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,switch1-cpu vlan-id=99

Packets that will be sent out from the CPU, for example, ping replies will not have a VLAN tag, to solve this you need to specify which ports should always send out packets with a VLAN tag for a specific VLAN ID:
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2,switch1-cpu vlan-id=99

After a valid VLAN99 configuration has been set up, you can enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering, which will not allow the management access through different ports than specified in the VLAN table:
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5

In this example VLAN99 will be used to access the device, a VLAN interface on the bridge must be created and an IP address must be assigned to it.
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
VLAN

It is recommended to get a Serial Console cable and testing it before configuring VLANs because you may lose access to the CPU and/or the port you are connected to.

Some changes may take some time to take effect due to already-learned MAC addresses. In such cases flushing the Unicast Forwarding Database can help: /interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb flush

Multiple hardware offloaded bridge configuration is designed as a fast and simple port isolation solution, but it limits part of the VLAN functionality supported by the CRS switch-chip. For advanced configurations use one bridge within the CRS switch chip for all ports, configure VLANs, and isolate port groups with port isolation profile configuration.
Port Based VLAN

For CRS3xx series devices, you must use bridge VLAN filtering, you can read more about it in the Bridge VLAN Filtering section.
Example 1 (Trunk and Access ports)

Switch together the required ports:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

Specify the VLAN ID that the switch must set on untagged (VLAN0) traffic for each access port:
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add ports=ether6 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=200
add ports=ether7 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=300
add ports=ether8 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=400

When an entry is created under /interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation, then the switch chip will add a VLAN tag on ingress frames on the specified port. To remove the VLAN tag on the same port for egress frames, an /interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag entry should be created for the same VLAN ID where only tagged ports are specified. If a specific VLAN is forwarded only between access ports, the /interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag entry should still be created without any tagged ports. Another option is to create extra entries under /interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-translation menu to set untagged (VLAN0) traffic.

You must also specify which VLANs should be sent out to the trunk port with a VLAN tag. Use the tagged-ports property to set up a trunk port:
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=200
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=300
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=400

Add entries to the VLAN table to specify VLAN memberships for each port and each VLAN ID:
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,ether6 vlan-id=200
add ports=ether2,ether7 vlan-id=300
add ports=ether2,ether8 vlan-id=400

After a valid VLAN configuration has been set up, you can enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering:
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8

It is possible to use the built-in switch chip and the CPU at the same time to create a Switch-Router setup, where a device acts as a switch and as a router simultaneously. You can find a configuration example in the CRS-Router guide.
Example 2 (Trunk and Hybrid Ports)

Switch together the required ports:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

Specify the VLAN ID that the switch must set on untagged (VLAN0) traffic for each access port:
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add ports=ether6 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=200
add ports=ether7 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=300
add ports=ether8 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=400

By specifying ports as tagged-ports, the switch will always send out packets as tagged packets with the corresponding VLAN ID. Add appropriate entries according to the diagram above:
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2,ether7,ether8 vlan-id=200
add tagged-ports=ether2,ether6,ether8 vlan-id=300
add tagged-ports=ether2,ether6,ether7 vlan-id=400

Add entries to the VLAN table to specify VLAN memberships for each port and each VLAN ID:
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8 vlan-id=200 learn=yes
add ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8 vlan-id=300 learn=yes
add ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8 vlan-id=400 learn=yes

After a valid VLAN configuration has been set up, you can enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering:
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8
Protocol Based VLAN

Switch together the required ports:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

Set VLAN for IP and ARP protocols:
/interface ethernet switch protocol-based-vlan
add port=ether2 protocol=arp set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether6 protocol=arp set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=200
add port=ether2 protocol=ip set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether6 protocol=ip set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=200

Set VLAN for IPX protocol:
/interface ethernet switch protocol-based-vlan
add port=ether2 protocol=ipx set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether7 protocol=ipx set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=300

Set VLAN for AppleTalk AARP and AppleTalk DDP protocols:
/interface ethernet switch protocol-based-vlan
add port=ether2 protocol=0x80F3 set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether8 protocol=0x80F3 set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=400
add port=ether2 protocol=0x809B set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether8 protocol=0x809B set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=400
MAC Based VLAN

Internally all MAC addresses in MAC-based VLANs are hashed, certain MAC addresses can have the same hash, which will prevent a MAC address from being loaded into the switch chip if the hash matches with a hash from a MAC address that has been already loaded, for this reason, it is recommended to use Port bases VLANs in combination with MAC-based VLANs. This is a hardware limitation.

Switch together the required ports:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes

Enable MAC-based VLAN translation on access port:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether7 allow-fdb-based-vlan-translate=yes

Add MAC-to-VLAN mapping entries in the MAC-based VLAN table:
/interface ethernet switch mac-based-vlan
add src-mac=A4:12:6D:77:94:43 new-customer-vid=200
add src-mac=84:37:62:DF:04:20 new-customer-vid=300
add src-mac=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 new-customer-vid=400

Add VLAN200, VLAN300, and VLAN400 tagging on the ether2 port to create it as a VLAN trunk port:
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=200
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=300
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=400

Additionally, add entries to the VLAN table, specify VLAN membership for each port, and enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering, see an example below - Unknown/Invalid VLAN filtering. This is required for network setups where more interfaces are added to the bridge, as it allows to define VLAN boundaries.
InterVLAN Routing

InterVLAN routing configuration consists of two main parts – VLAN tagging in switch-chip and routing in RouterOS. This configuration can be used in many applications by combining it with a DHCP server, Hotspot, PPP, and other features for each VLAN.

Switch together the required ports:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

Set VLAN tagging on the CPU port for all VLANs to make packets tagged before they are routed:
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=switch1-cpu vlan-id=200
add tagged-ports=switch1-cpu vlan-id=300
add tagged-ports=switch1-cpu vlan-id=400

add ingress VLAN translation rules to ensure that the correct VLAN ID assignment is done on access ports:
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add ports=ether6 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=200
add ports=ether7 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=300
add ports=ether8 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=400

Create the VLAN interfaces on top of the bridge interface:
/interface vlan
add name=VLAN200 interface=bridge1 vlan-id=200
add name=VLAN300 interface=bridge1 vlan-id=300
add name=VLAN400 interface=bridge1 vlan-id=400

Make sure the VLAN interfaces are created on top of the bridge interface instead of any of the physical interfaces. If the VLAN interfaces are created on a slave interface, then the packet might not be received correctly, and therefore routing might fail. More detailed information can be found in the VLAN interface on a slave interface manual page.

Add IP addresses on created VLAN interfaces. In this example, three 192.168.x.1 addresses are added to VLAN200, VLAN300, and VLAN400 interfaces:
/ip address
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=VLAN200
add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=VLAN300
add address=192.168.40.1/24 interface=VLAN400
Unknown/Invalid VLAN filtering

VLAN membership is defined in the VLAN table. Adding entries with VLAN ID and ports makes that VLAN traffic valid on those ports. After a valid VLAN configuration has been set up, unknown/invalid VLAN filtering can be enabled. This VLAN filtering configuration example applies to the InterVLAN Routing setup.
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=switch1-cpu,ether6 vlan-id=200
add ports=switch1-cpu,ether7 vlan-id=300
add ports=switch1-cpu,ether8 vlan-id=400

    Option 1: disable invalid VLAN forwarding on specific ports (more common):


/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8

    Option 2: disable invalid VLAN forwarding on all ports:

/interface ethernet switch
set forward-unknown-vlan=no

Using multiple bridges on a single switch chip with enabled unknown/invalid VLAN filtering can cause unexpected behavior. You should always use a single bridge configuration whenever using VLAN filtering. If port isolation is required, then the port isolation feature should be used instead of using multiple bridges.
VLAN Tunneling (Q-in-Q)

This example covers a typical VLAN tunneling use case where service provider devices add another VLAN tag for independent forwarding in the meantime allowing customers to use their own VLANs.

This example contains only the Service VLAN tagging part. It is recommended to additionally set Unknown/Invalid VLAN filtering configuration on ports.

CRS-1: The first switch on the edge of the service provider network has to properly identify traffic from the customer VLAN ID on port and assign a new service VLAN ID with ingress VLAN translation rules. VLAN trunk port configuration for service provider VLAN tags is in the same egress-vlan-tag table. The main difference from basic Port-Based VLAN configuration is that the CRS switch-chip has to be set to do forwarding according to service (outer) VLAN ID instead of customer (inner) VLAN ID.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether9 hw=yes

/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add customer-vid=200 new-service-vid=400 ports=ether1
add customer-vid=300 new-service-vid=500 ports=ether2

/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether9 vlan-id=400
add tagged-ports=ether9 vlan-id=500

/interface ethernet switch
set bridge-type=service-vid-used-as-lookup-vid

CRS-2: The second switch in the service provider network requires only switched ports to do forwarding according to service (outer) VLAN ID instead of customer (inner) VLAN ID.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether9 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether10 hw=yes

/interface ethernet switch
set bridge-type=service-vid-used-as-lookup-vid

CRS-3: The third switch has a similar configuration to CRS-1:

    Ports in a switch group using a bridge;
    Ingress VLAN translation rules to define new service VLAN assignments on ports;
    tagged-ports for service provider VLAN trunks;
    CRS switch-chip set to use service VLAN ID in switching lookup.

/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether10 hw=yes

/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add customer-vid=200 new-service-vid=400 ports=ether3
add customer-vid=300 new-service-vid=500 ports=ether4

/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether10 vlan-id=400
add tagged-ports=ether10 vlan-id=500

/interface ethernet switch
set bridge-type=service-vid-used-as-lookup-vid
CVID Stacking

It is possible to use CRS1xx/CRS2xx series switches for CVID Stacking setups. CRS1xx/CRS2xx series switches are capable of VLAN filtering based on the outer tag of tagged packets that have two CVID tags (double CVID tag), these switches are also capable of adding another CVID tag on top of an existing CVID tag (CVID Stacking). For example, in a setup where ether1 is receiving tagged packets with CVID 10, but it is required that ether2 sends out these packets with another tag CVID 20 (VLAN10 inside VLAN20) while filtering out any other VLANs, the following must be configured:

Switch together ether1 and ether2:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes

Set the switch to filter VLANs based on the service tag (0x88a8):
/interface ethernet switch
set bridge-type=service-vid-used-as-lookup-vid

Add a service tag SVID 20 to packets that have a CVID 10 tag on ether1:
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add customer-vid=10 new-service-vid=20 ports=ether1

Specify ether2 as the tagged/trunk port for SVID 20:
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=20

Allow ether1 and ether2 to forward SVID 20:
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2 vlan-id=20

Override the SVID EtherType (0x88a8) to CVID EtherType (0x8100) on ether2:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 egress-service-tpid-override=0x8100 ingress-service-tpid-override=0x8100

Enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering:
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether1,ether2

Since the switch is set to look up VLAN ID based on the service tag, which is overridden with a different EtherType, then VLAN filtering is only done on the outer tag of a packet, the inner tag is not checked.
Mirroring

The Cloud Router Switches support three types of mirroring. Port-based mirroring can be applied to any switch-chip ports, VLAN-based mirroring works for all specified VLANs regardless of switch-chip ports, and MAC-based mirroring copies traffic sent or received from specific device reachable from the port configured in Unicast Forwarding Database.
Port-Based Mirroring

The first configuration sets the ether5 port as a mirror0 analyzer port for both ingress and egress mirroring, mirrored traffic will be sent to this port. Port-based ingress and egress mirroring are enabled from the ether6 port.
/interface ethernet switch
set ingress-mirror0=ether5 egress-mirror0=ether5

/interface ethernet switch port
set ether6 ingress-mirror-to=mirror0 egress-mirror-to=mirror0
VLAN Based Mirroring

The second example requires ports to be switched in a group. Mirroring configuration sets the ether5 port as a mirror0 analyzer port and sets the mirror0 port to be used when mirroring from VLAN occurs. VLAN table entry enables mirroring only for VLAN 300 traffic between ether2 and ether7 ports.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes

/interface ethernet switch
set ingress-mirror0=ether5 vlan-uses=mirror0

/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,ether7 vlan-id=300 learn=yes ingress-mirror=yes
MAC Based Mirroring

The third configuration also requires ports to be switched in a group. Mirroring configuration sets the ether5 port as a mirror0 analyzer port and sets the mirror0 port to be used when mirroring from the Unicast Forwarding database occurs. The entry from the Unicast Forwarding database enables mirroring for packets with source or destination MAC address E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 from ether8 port.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

/interface ethernet switch
set ingress-mirror0=ether5 fdb-uses=mirror0

/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add port=ether8 mirror=yes svl=yes mac-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18
Trunking

The Trunking in the Cloud Router Switches provides static link aggregation groups with hardware automatic failover and load balancing. IEEE802.3ad and IEEE802.1ax compatible Link Aggregation Control Protocol is not supported yet. Up to 8 Trunk groups are supported with up to 8 Trunk member ports per Trunk group.

Configuration requires a group of switched ports and an entry in the Trunk table:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 protocol-mode=none
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

/interface ethernet switch trunk
add name=trunk1 member-ports=ether6,ether7,ether8

This example also shows proper bonding configuration in RouterOS on the other end:
/interface bonding
add name=bonding1 slaves=ether2,ether3,ether4 mode=balance-xor transmit-hash-policy=layer-2-and-3

You can find a working example for trunking and port-based VLANs on CRS VLANs with Trunks page.

Bridge (R)STP is not aware of the underlying switch trunking configuration and some trunk ports can move to a discarding or blocking state. When trunking member ports are connected to other bridges, you should either disable the (R)STP or filter out any BPDU between trunked devices (e.g. with ACL rules).
Limited MAC Access per Port

Disabling MAC learning and configuring static MAC addresses gives the ability to control what exact devices can communicate to CRS1xx/2xx switches and through them.

Configuration requires a group of switched ports, disabled MAC learning on those ports, and static UFDB entries:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes learn=no unknown-unicast-flood=no
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes learn=no unknown-unicast-flood=no

/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add mac-address=4C:5E:0C:00:00:01 port=ether6 svl=yes
add mac-address=D4:CA:6D:00:00:02 port=ether7 svl=yes

/interface ethernet switch acl
add action=drop src-mac-addr-state=sa-not-found src-ports=ether6,ether7 table=egress
add action=drop src-mac-addr-state=static-station-move src-ports=ether6,ether7 table=egress

CRS1xx/2xx switches also allow to learn one dynamic MAC per port to ensure only one end-user device is connected no matter its MAC address:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether6 learn-limit=1
set ether7 learn-limit=1
Isolation
Port Level Isolation

Port-level isolation is often used for Private VLAN, where:

    One or multiple uplink ports are shared among all users for accessing the gateway or router.
    Port group Isolated Ports is for guest users. Communication is through the uplink ports only.
    Port group Community 0 is for department A. Communication is allowed between the group members and through uplink ports.
    Port group Community X is for department X. Communication is allowed between the group members and through uplink ports.

The Cloud Router Switches use port-level isolation profiles for Private VLAN implementation:

    Uplink ports – port-level isolation profile 0
    Isolated ports – port-level isolation profile 1
    Community 0 ports - port-level isolation profile 2
    Community X (X <= 30) ports - port-level isolation profile X

This example requires a group of switched ports. Assume that all ports used in this example are in one switch group.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether9 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether10 hw=yes

The first part of port isolation configuration is setting the Uplink port – set a port profile to 0 for ether2:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 isolation-leakage-profile-override=0

Then continue with setting isolation profile 1 to all isolated ports and adding the communication port for port isolation profile 1:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether5 isolation-leakage-profile-override=1
set ether6 isolation-leakage-profile-override=1

/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
add port-profile=1 ports=ether2 type=dst

Configuration to set Community 2 and Community 3 ports is similar:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether7 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
set ether8 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2

/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
add port-profile=2 ports=ether2,ether7,ether8 type=dst

/interface ethernet switch port
set ether9 isolation-leakage-profile-override=3
set ether10 isolation-leakage-profile-override=3

/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
add port-profile=3 ports=ether2,ether9,ether10 type=dst
Protocol Level Isolation


Protocol level isolation on CRS switches can be used to enhance network security. For example, restricting DHCP traffic between the users (ether2, ether3, ether4, ether5) and allowing it only to trusted DHCP server ports (ether1) can prevent security risks like DHCP spoofing attacks. The following example shows how to configure it on CRS.

Switch together the required ports:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes

Set the same Community port profile for all DHCP client ports. Community port profile numbers are from 2 to 30.
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
set ether3 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
set ether4 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
set ether5 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2

And configure port isolation/leakage profile for selected Community (2) to allow DHCP traffic destined only to the port where the trusted DHCP server is located. registration status and traffic-type properties have to be set empty to apply restrictions only for DHCP protocol.
/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
add port-profile=2 protocol-type=dhcpv4 type=dst forwarding-type=bridged ports=ether1 registration-status="" traffic-type=""
Quality of Service (QoS)

QoS configuration schemes

MAC based traffic scheduling and shaping: [MAC address in UFDB] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]

VLAN based traffic scheduling and shaping: [VLAN id in VLAN table] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]

Protocol based traffic scheduling and shaping: [Protocol in Protocol VLAN table] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]

PCP/DEI based traffic scheduling and shaping: [Switch port PCP/DEI mapping] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]

DSCP based traffic scheduling and shaping: [QoS DSCP mapping] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
MAC-based traffic scheduling using internal Priority

In Strict Priority scheduling mode, the highest priority queue is served first. The queue number represents the priority and the queue with the highest queue number has the highest priority. Traffic is transmitted from the highest priority queue until the queue is empty, and then moves to the next highest priority queue, and so on. If no congestion is present at the egress port, a packet is transmitted as soon as it is received. If congestion occurs in the port where high-priority traffic keeps coming, the lower-priority queues starve.

On all CRS switches the scheme where MAC-based egress traffic scheduling is done according to internal Priority would be the following: [MAC address] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue];
In this example, host1 (E7:16:34:00:00:01) and host2 (E7:16:34:00:00:02) will have higher priority 1 and the rest of the hosts will have lower priority 0 for transmitted traffic on port ether7. Note that CRS has a maximum of 8 queues per port.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

Create a QoS group for use in UFDB:
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group1 priority=1

Add UFDB entries to match specific MACs on ether7 and apply the QoS group1:
/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add mac-address=E7:16:34:00:00:01 port=ether7 qos-group=group1 svl=yes
add mac-address=E7:16:34:00:00:02 port=ether7 qos-group=group1 svl=yes

Configure ether7 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS scheme only for destination address:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether7 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1 qos-scheme-precedence=da-based
MAC-based traffic shaping using internal Priority

The scheme where MAC-based traffic shaping is done according to internal Priority would be following: [MAC address] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper];
In this example, unlimited traffic will have priority 0 and limited traffic will have priority 1 with a bandwidth limit of 10Mbit. Note that CRS has a maximum of 8 queues per port.

Create a group of ports for switching:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

Create a QoS group for use in UFDB:
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group1 priority=1

Add UFDB entry to match specific MAC on ether8 and apply QoS group1:
/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add mac-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 port=ether8 qos-group=group1 svl=yes

Configure ether8 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS scheme only for destination address:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether8 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1 qos-scheme-precedence=da-based

Apply bandwidth limit for queue1 on ether8:
/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether8 rate=10M target=queue1

If the CRS switch supports Access Control List, this configuration is simpler:
/interface ethernet switch acl policer
add name=policer1 yellow-burst=100k yellow-rate=10M

/interface ethernet switch acl
add mac-dst-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 policer=policer1
VLAN-based traffic scheduling + shaping using internal Priorities

The best practice is to assign lower internal QoS Priority for traffic limited by shaper to make it also less important in the Strict Priority scheduler. (higher priority should be more important and unlimited)

In this example:
Switch port ether6 is using a shaper to limit the traffic that comes from ether7 and ether8.
When the link has reached its capacity, the traffic with the highest priority will be sent out first.
VLAN10 -> QoS group0 = lowest priority
VLAN20 -> QoS group1 = normal priority
VLAN30 -> QoS group2 = highest priority
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes

Create QoS groups for use in the VLAN table.
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group0 priority=0
add name=group1 priority=1
add name=group2 priority=2

Add VLAN entries to apply QoS groups for certain VLANs.
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group0 vlan-id=10
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group1 vlan-id=20
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group2 vlan-id=30

Configure ether6, ether7, and ether8 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS schemes only for VLAN-based QoS.
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether6 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 qos-scheme-precedence=vlan-based
set ether7 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 qos-scheme-precedence=vlan-based
set ether8 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 qos-scheme-precedence=vlan-based

Apply bandwidth limit on ether6.
/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether6 rate=10M
PCP-based traffic scheduling

By default, CRS1xx/CRS2xx series devices will ignore the PCP/CoS/802.1p value and forward packets based on FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner. When the device's internal queue is not full, then packets are sent in a FIFO manner, but as soon as a queue is filled, then higher-priority traffic can be sent out first. Let us consider a scenario when ether1 and ether2 are forwarding data to ether3, but when ether3 is congested, then packets are going to be scheduled, we can configure the switch to hold the lowest priority packets until all higher priority packets are sent out, this is a very common scenario for VoIP type setups, where some traffic needs to be prioritized.

To achieve such a behavior, switch together ether1, ether2, and ether3 ports:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes

Enable Strict Policy for each internal queue on each port:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0"

Map each PCP value to an internal priority value, for convenience reasons simply map PCP to an internal priority 1-to-1:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 pcp-based-qos-priority-mapping=0:0,1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:5,6:6,7:7

Since the switch will empty the largest queue first and you need the highest priority to be served first, then you can assign this internal priority to a queue 1-to-1:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:5,6:6,7:7

Finally, set each switch port to schedule packets based on the PCP value:
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 qos-scheme-precedence=pcp-based
Bandwidth Limiting

Both Ingress Port policer and Shaper provide bandwidth-limiting features for CRS switches.

    Ingress Port Policer sets RX limit on port:

/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 meter-unit=bit rate=10M

    Shaper sets TX limit on port:

/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether5 meter-unit=bit rate=10M
Traffic Storm Control

The same Ingress Port policer also can be used for traffic storm control to prevent disruptions on Layer 2 ports caused by broadcast, multicast, or unicast traffic storms.

    Broadcast storm control example on ether5 port with 500 packet limit per second:

/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 rate=500 meter-unit=packet packet-types=broadcast  

    Example with multiple packet types which includes ARP and ND protocols and unregistered multicast traffic. Unregistered multicast is traffic that is not defined in the Multicast Forwarding Database.

/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 rate=5k meter-unit=packet packet-types=broadcast,arp-or-nd,unregistered-multicast

    Summary
    Bonding
    Port switching
    Management IP
    Invalid VLAN filtering
    InterVLAN routing
    DHCP-Server
    Jumbo frames

Summary

This page will show how to configure multiple switches to use bonding interfaces and port-based VLANs, it will also show a working example with a DHCP-Server, inter-VLAN routing, management IP, and invalid VLAN filtering configuration.

This article applies to CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116, and CCR2216 devices. It doesn't apply to CRS1xx/CRS2xx series.

For this network topology, we will be using two CRS326-24G-2S+, one CRS317-1G-16S+, and one CCR1072-1G-8S+, but the same principles can be applied to any CRS3xx, CRS5xx series devices, and a router. 



In this setup, SwitchA and SwitchC will tag all traffic from ports ether1-ether8 to VLAN ID 10, ether9-ether16 to VLAN ID 20, and ether17-ether24 to VLAN ID 30. Management will only be possible if a user is connecting with tagged traffic with VLAN ID 99 from ether1 on SwitchA or SwitchB, connecting to all devices will also be possible from the router using tagged traffic with VLAN ID 99. The SFP+ ports in this setup are going to be used as VLAN trunk ports while being in a bond to create a LAG interface.
Bonding

Bonding interfaces are used when a larger amount of bandwidth is required, this is done by creating a link aggregation group, which also provides hardware automatic failover and load balancing for switches. By adding two 10Gbps interfaces to bonding, you can increase the theoretical bandwidth limit to 20Gbps. Make sure that all bonded interfaces are linked to the same speed rates.

When using the hardware-offloaded bridge, the CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116, and CCR2216 devices aggregate traffic using the built-in switch chip without using CPU resources. To route the traffic a router with a powerful CPU is required to handle the aggregated traffic.

To create a 20Gbps bonding interface from sfp-sfpplus1 and sfp-sfpplus2 between SwitchA to SwitchB and between SwitchC to SwitchB, use these commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_1-2 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2

To create a 40Gbps bonding interface between SwitchB and the Router and a 20Gbps bonding interface between SwitchA and SwitchC, use these commands on SwitchB:
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_1-2 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_3-4 slaves=sfp-sfpplus3,sfp-sfpplus4
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_5-6-7-8 slaves=sfp-sfpplus5,sfp-sfpplus6,sfp-sfpplus7,sfp-sfpplus8

In our case the Router needs a software-based bonding interface, use these commands on the Router:
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_1-2-3-4 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2,sfp-sfpplus3,sfp-sfpplus4

Interface bonding does not create an interface with a larger link speed. Interface bonding creates a virtual interface that can load balance traffic over multiple interfaces. More details can be found on the LAG interfaces and load balancing page.
Port switching

All switches in this setup require that all used ports are switched together. For bonding, you should add the bonding interface as a bridge port, instead of individual bonding ports. Use these commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge vlan-filtering=no
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether4 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether5 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether6 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether7 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether8 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether9 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether10 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether11 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether12 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether13 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether14 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether15 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether16 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether17 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether18 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether19 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether20 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether21 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether22 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether23 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether24 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=bond_1-2

Add all bonding interfaces to a single bridge on SwitchB by using these commands on SwitchB:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge vlan-filtering=no
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=bond_1-2
add bridge=bridge interface=bond_3-4
add bridge=bridge interface=bond_5-6-7-8
Management IP

It is very useful to create a management interface and assign an IP address to it to preserve access to the switch. This is also very useful when updating your switches since such traffic to the switch will be blocked when enabling invalid VLAN filtering.

Create a routable VLAN interface on SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC:
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge name=MGMT vlan-id=99

The Router needs a routable VLAN interface to be created on the bonding interface, use these commands to create a VLAN interface on the Router:
/interface vlan
add interface=bond_1-2-3-4 name=MGMT vlan-id=99

For this guide, we are going to use these addresses for each device:
Router	192.168.99.1
SwitchA	192.168.99.2
SwitchB	192.168.99.3
SwitchC	192.168.99.4

Add an IP address for each switch device on the VLAN interface (change X to the appropriate number):
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.X/24 interface=MGMT

Do not forget to add the default gateway and specify a DNS server on the switch devices:
/ip route
add gateway=192.168.99.1
/ip dns
set servers=192.168.99.1

Add the IP address on the Router:
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
Invalid VLAN filtering

Since most ports on SwitchA and SwitchC are going to be access ports, you can set all ports to accept only certain types of packets, in this case, we will want SwitchA and SwitchC to only accept untagged packets, use these commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
/interface bridge port
set [ find ] frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged

There is an exception for frame types on SwitchA and SwitchC, in this setup access to the management is required from ether1 and bonding interfaces, they require that tagged traffic can be forwarded. Use these commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
/interface bridge port
set [find where interface=ether1] frame-types=admit-all
set [find where interface=bond_1-2] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged

On SwitchB only tagged packets should be forwarded, use these commands on SwitchB:
/interface bridge port
set [ find ] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged

An optional step is to set frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged on the bridge interface to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (pvid=1). We are using the tagged VLAN on the bridge for management access, so there is no need to accept untagged traffic on the bridge. Use these commands on the SwitchA, SwitchB and SwitchC:
/interface bridge set [find name=bridge] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged

It is required to set up a bridge VLAN table. In this network setup, we need to allow VLAN 10 on ether1-ether8, VLAN 20 on ether9-ether16, VLAN 30 on ether17-ether24, VLAN 10,20,30,99 on bond_1-2, and a special case for ether1 to allow to forward VLAN 99 on SwitchA and SwitchC. Use these commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2 vlan-ids=30
add bridge=bridge tagged=bridge,bond_1-2,ether1 vlan-ids=99

Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-all or admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.

Similarly, it is required to set up a bridge VLAN table for SwitchB. Use these commands on SwitchB:
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2,bond_3-4,bond_5-6-7-8 vlan-ids=10,20,30
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2,bond_3-4,bond_5-6-7-8,bridge vlan-ids=99

When everything is configured, VLAN filtering can be enabled. Use these commands on SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC:
/interface bridge
set bridge vlan-filtering=yes

Double-check if port-based VLANs are set up properly. If a mistake was made, you might lose access to the switch and it can only be regained by resetting the configuration or by using the serial console.

VLAN filtering is described more in the Bridge VLAN Filtering section.
InterVLAN routing

To create InterVLAN routing, the VLAN interface for each customer VLAN ID must be created on the router and must have an IP address assigned to it. The VLAN interface must be created on the bonding interface created previously.

Use these commands on the Router:
/interface vlan
add interface=bond_1-2-3-4 name=VLAN10 vlan-id=10
add interface=bond_1-2-3-4 name=VLAN20 vlan-id=20
add interface=bond_1-2-3-4 name=VLAN30 vlan-id=30
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=VLAN10
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=VLAN20
add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=VLAN30

These commands are required for DHCP-Server. In case interVLAN routing is not desired but a DHCP-Server on a single router is required, then use Firewall Filter to block access between different subnets.

Since RouterOS v7, it is possible to route traffic using the L3 HW offloading on certain devices. See more details on L3 Hardware Offloading.
DHCP-Server

To get the DHCP-Server working for each VLAN ID, the server must be set up on the previously created VLAN interfaces (one server for each VLAN ID). Preferably each VLAN ID should have its own subnet and its own IP pool. A DNS Server could be specified as the router's IP address for a particular VLAN ID or a global DNS Server could be used, but this address must be reachable.

To set up the DHCP-Server, use these commands on the Router:
/ip pool
add name=VLAN10_POOL ranges=192.168.10.100-192.168.10.200
add name=VLAN20_POOL ranges=192.168.20.100-192.168.20.200
add name=VLAN30_POOL ranges=192.168.30.100-192.168.30.200
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=VLAN10_POOL disabled=no interface=VLAN10 name=VLAN10_DHCP
add address-pool=VLAN20_POOL disabled=no interface=VLAN20 name=VLAN20_DHCP
add address-pool=VLAN30_POOL disabled=no interface=VLAN30 name=VLAN30_DHCP
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.10.0/24 dns-server=192.168.10.1 gateway=192.168.10.1
add address=192.168.20.0/24 dns-server=192.168.20.1 gateway=192.168.20.1
add address=192.168.30.0/24 dns-server=192.168.30.1 gateway=192.168.30.1

In case the router's DNS Server is being used, don't forget to allow remote requests and make sure DNS Servers are configured on the router. Use these commands on the Router:
/ip dns
set allow-remote-requests=yes servers=8.8.8.8

Make sure to secure your local DNS Server with Firewall from the outside when using allow-remote-requests set to yes since your DNS Server can be used for DDoS attacks if it is accessible from the Internet by anyone.

Don't forget to create NAT, assuming that sfp-sfpplus8 is used as WAN port, use these commands on the Router:
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=sfp-sfpplus8
Jumbo frames

One can increase the total throughput in such a setup by enabling jumbo frames. This reduces the packet overhead by increasing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). If a device in your network does not support jumbo frames, then it will not benefit from a larger MTU. Usually, the whole network does not support jumbo frames, but you can still benefit when sending data between devices that support jumbo frames, including all switches in the path.

In this case, if clients behind SwitchA and client behind SwitchC support jumbo frames, then enabling jumbo frames will be beneficial. Before enabling jumbo frames, determine the MAX-L2MTU by using this command:
[admin@SwitchA] > interface print 
Flags: R - RUNNING
Columns: NAME, TYPE, ACTUAL-MTU, L2MTU, MAX-L2MTU, MAC-ADDRESS
 #   NAME           TYPE   ACTUAL-MTU  L2MTU  MAX-L2MTU  MAC-ADDRESS      
 1 R sfp-sfpplus1   ether        1500   1584      10218  64:D1:54:FF:E3:7F

More information can be found in MTU manual page.

When MAX-L2MTU is determined, choose the MTU size depending on the traffic on your network, use this command on SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC:
/interface ethernet
set [ find ] l2mtu=10218 mtu=10218

Don't forget to change the MTU on your client devices too, otherwise, the above-mentioned settings will not have any effect.

Introduction

There are certain configurations that are known to have major flaws by design and should be avoided by all means possible. Misconfigured Layer2 can sometimes cause hard to detect network errors, random performance drops, certain segments of a network to be unreachable, certain networking services to be malfunctioning, or a complete network failure. This page will contain some common and not so very common configurations that will cause issues in your network.
Bridges on a single switch chip

Consider the following scenario, you have a device with a built-in switch chip and you need to isolate certain ports from each other, for this reason, you have created multiple bridges and enabled hardware offloading on them. Since each bridge is located on a different Layer2 domain, then Layer2 frames will not be forwarded between these bridges, as a result, ports in each bridge are isolated from other ports on a different bridge.
Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
add name=bridge2
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether4
Problem

After a simple performance test, you might notice that one bridge is capable of forwarding traffic at wire speed while the second, third, etc. bridge is not able to forward as much data as the first bridge. Another symptom might be that there exists a huge latency for packets that need to be routed. After a quick inspection, you might notice that the CPU is always at full load, this is because hardware offloading is not available on all bridges, but is available only on one bridge. By checking the hardware offloading status you will notice that only one bridge has it active:
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload 
 #     INTERFACE                                 BRIDGE                                 HW
 0   H ether1                                    bridge1                                yes
 1   H ether2                                    bridge1                                yes
 2     ether3                                    bridge2                                yes
 3     ether4                                    bridge2                                yes

The reason why only one bridge has the hardware offloading flag available is that the device does not support port isolation. If port isolation is not supported, then only one bridge will be able to offload the traffic to the switch chip.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Missing "H" flag to bridge ports
    Low throughput
    High CPU usage

Solution

Not all device devices support port isolation, currently only CRS1xx/CRS2xx series devices support it and only 7 isolated and hardware offloaded bridges are supported at the same time, other devices will have to use the CPU to forward the packets on other bridges. This is usually a hardware limitation and a different device might be required. Bridge split-horizon parameter is a software feature that disables hardware offloading and when using bridge filter rules you need to enable forward all packets to the CPU, which requires the hardware offloading to be disabled. You can control which bridge will be hardware offloaded with the hw=yes flag and by setting hw=no to other bridges, for example:
/interface bridge port set [find where bridge=bridge1] hw=no
/interface bridge port set [find where bridge=bridge2] hw=yes

Sometimes it is possible to restructure a network topology to use VLANs, which is the proper way to isolate Layer2 networks.
Packet flow with hardware offloading and MAC learning

Consider the following scenario, you set up a bridge and have enabled hardware offloading in order to maximize the throughput for your device, as a result, your device is working as a switch, but you want to use Sniffer or Torch tools for debugging purposes, or maybe you want to implement packet logging.
Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 hw=yes interface=ether1 learn=yes
add bridge=bridge1 hw=yes interface=ether2 learn=yes
Problem

When running Sniffer or Torch tools to capture packets you might notice that barely any packets are visible, only some unicast packets, but mostly broadcast/multicast packets are captured, while the interfaces report that much larger traffic is flowing through certain interfaces than the traffic that was captured. If you add two or more Ethernet interfaces to a bridge and enable Hardware Offloading, then the switch chip will be used to forward packets between ports. To understand why only some packets are captured, we must first examine how the switch chip is interconnected with the CPU, in this example, we can use a block diagram from a generic 5-Port Ethernet router:

For this device, each Ethernet port is connected to the switch chip and the switch chip is connected to the CPU using the CPU port (sometimes called the switch-cpu port). For packets to be visible in Sniffer or Torch tools, the packet must be sent from an Ethernet port to the CPU port, this means that the packet must be destined to the CPU port (destination MAC address of the packet matches the bridge's MAC address) or the packet's MAC address has not be learnt (packet is flooded to all ports), this behavior is because of MAC learning·

The switch chip keeps a list of MAC addresses and ports called the Host table· Whenever a packet needs to be forwarded, the switch chip checks the packet's destination MAC address against the hosts table to find which port should it use to forward the packet. If the switch chip cannot find the destination MAC address, then the packet is flooded to all ports (including the CPU port). In situations where a packet is supposed to be forwarded from, for example, ether1 to ether2 and the MAC address for the device behind ether2 is in the host table, then the packet is never sent to the CPU and therefore will not be visible to Sniffer or Torch tool.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Packets not visible by Sniffer or Torch tool
    Filter rules not working

Solution

Packets with a destination MAC address that has been learned will not be sent to the CPU since the packets are not being flooded to all ports. If you do need to send certain packets to the CPU for a packet analyzer or a firewall, then it is possible to copy or redirect the packet to the CPU by using ACL rules. Below is an example of how to send a copy of packets that are meant for 4C:5E:0C:4D:12:4B:
/interface ethernet switch rule
add copy-to-cpu=yes dst-mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:4B/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF ports=ether1 switch=switch1


If the packet is sent to the CPU, then the packet must be processed by the CPU, this increases the CPU load.
LAG interfaces and load balancing

Consider the following scenario, you have created a LAG interface to increase total bandwidth between 2 network nodes, usually, these are switches. For testing purposes to make sure that the LAG interface is working properly you have attached two servers that transfer data, most commonly the well-known network performance measurement tool https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iperf is used to test such setups. For example, you might have made a LAG interface out of two Gigabit Ethernet ports, which gives you a virtual interface that can load balance traffic over both interfaces and theoretically reach 2Gbps throughput, while the servers are connected using a 10Gbps interface, for example, SFP+.

Configuration

The following configuration is relevant to SW1 and SW2:
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=ether1,ether2
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=bond1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1
Problem

After initial tests, you immediately notice that your network throughput never exceeds the 1Gbps limit even though the CPU load on the servers is low as well as on the network nodes (switches in this case), but the throughput is still limited to only 1Gbps. The reason behind this is because LACP (802.ad) uses transmit hash policy in order to determine if traffic can be balanced over multiple LAG members, in this case, a LAG interface does not create a 2Gbps interface, but rather an interface that can balance traffic over multiple slave interface whenever it is possible. For each packet a transmit hash is generated, this determines through which LAG member will the packet be sent, this is needed in order to avoid packets being out of order, there is an option to select the transmit hash policy, usually, there is an option to choose between Layer2 (MAC), Layer3 (IP) and Layer4 (Port), in RouterOS, this can be selected by using the transmit-hash-policy parameter. In this case, the transmit hash is the same since you are sending packets to the same destination MAC address, as well as the same IP address and Iperf uses the same port as well, this generates the same transmit hash for all packets and load balancing between LAG members is not possible. Note that not always packets will get balanced over LAG members even though the destination is different, this is because the standardized transmit hash policy can generate the same transmit hash for different destinations, for example, 192.168.0.1/192.168.0.2 will get balanced, but 192.168.0.2/192.168.0.4 will NOT get balanced in case layer2-and-3 transmit hash policy is used and the destination MAC address is the same.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Traffic going through only one LAG member

Solution

Choose the proper transmit hash policy and test your network's throughput properly. The simplest way to test such setups is to use multiple destinations, for example, instead of sending data to just one server, rather send data to multiple servers, this will generate a different transmit hash for each packet and will make load balancing across LAG members possible. For some setups, you might want to change the bonding interface mode to increase the total throughput, for UDP traffic balance-rr mode might be sufficient, but can cause issues for TCP traffic, you can read more about selecting the right mode for your setup here.
VLAN interface on a slave interface

Consider the following scenario, you have created a bridge and you want a DHCP Server to give out IP addresses only to a certain tagged VLAN traffic, for this reason, you have created a VLAN interface, specified a VLAN ID and created a DHCP Server on it, but for some reason, it is not working properly.
Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1
/interface vlan
add name=VLAN99 interface=ether1 vlan-id=99
/ip pool
add name=VLAN99_POOL range=192.168.99.100-192.168.99.200
/ip address add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=VLAN99
/ip dhcp-server
add interface=VLAN99 address-pool=VLAN99_POOL disabled=no
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.99.0/24 gateway=192.168.99.1 dns-server=192.168.99.1
Problem

When you add an interface to a bridge, the bridge becomes the master interface and all bridge ports become slave ports, this means that all traffic that is received on a bridge port is captured by the bridge interface and all traffic is forwarded to the CPU using the bridge interface instead of the physical interface. As a result VLAN interface that is created on a slave interface will never capture any traffic at all since it is immediately forwarded to the master interface before any packet processing is being done. The usual side effect is that some DHCP clients receive IP addresses and some don't.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    DHCP Client/Server not working properly;
    Device is unreachable;
    The device behind a bridge is unreachable with tagged traffic;

Solution

Change the interface on which the VLAN interface will be listening for traffic, change it to the master interface:
/interface vlan set VLAN99 interface=bridge1
VLAN on a bridge in a bridge

Consider the following scenario, you have a set of interfaces (don't have to be physical interfaces) and you want all of them to be in the same Layer2 segment, the solution is to add them to a single bridge, but you require that traffic from one port tags all traffic into a certain VLAN. This can be done by creating a VLAN interface on top of the bridge interface and by creating a separate bridge that contains this newly created VLAN interface and an interface, which is supposed to add a VLAN tag to all received traffic. A network diagram can be found below:

Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
add name=bridge2
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN vlan-id=99
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge2 interface=VLAN
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether3
Problem

To better understand the underlying problems, let's first look at the bridge host table.
[admin@switch] /interface bridge host print where !local 
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, L - local, E - external 
 #       MAC-ADDRESS        VID ON-INTERFACE    BRIDGE
 0   D   CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A1      ether1          bridge1
 1   D   CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A2      ether2          bridge1
 2   D   CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A1      VLAN            bridge2
 3   D   CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A2      VLAN            bridge2
 4   D   CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A3      ether3          bridge2

Devices on ether1 and ether2 need to send tagged packets with VLAN-ID 99 in order to reach the host on ether3 (other packets do not get passed towards VLAN interface and further bridged with ether3). We can see in the host table that bridge2 has learned these hosts. Packets coming from ether3 to ether1 will be correctly sent out tagged and traffic will not be flooded in bridge1. But since MAC learning is only possible between bridge ports and not on interfaces that are created on top of the bridge interface, packets sent from ether2 to ether3 will be flooded in bridge1.

Also if a device behind ether3 is using (R)STP, then ether1 and ether2 will send out tagged BPDUs which violates the IEEE 802.1W standard. Because of the broken MAC learning functionality and broken (R)STP this setup and configuration must be avoided. It is also known that in some setups this kind of configuration can prevent you from connecting to the device by using MAC telnet.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Port blocked by RSTP
    Loops in network
    Port flapping
    Traffic is flooded to all ports
    MAC telnet is unable to connect
    Device inaccessible

Solution

Use bridge VLAN filtering. The proper way to tag traffic is to assign a VLAN ID whenever traffic enters a bridge, this behavior can easily be achieved by specifying PVID value for a bridge port and specifying which ports are tagged (trunk) ports and which are untagged (access) ports. Below is an example of how such a setup should have been configured:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=99
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1,ether2 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=99


By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you set up a Management port.
VLAN in a bridge with a physical interface

Very similar case to VLAN on a bridge in a bridge. The most popular use case is when you want to bridge a physical interface with a VLAN (simplified trunk/access port setup). In such setup you might want to send out tagged traffic on one side and untagged on the other side. To acomplish this, you create a VLAN interface on the trunk port (the tagged side), then create a bridge and add both the VLAN interface and the physical interface (the untagged side) as bridge ports.
Configuration
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=VLAN99 vlan-id=99
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1
add interface=VLAN99 bridge=bridge1
Problem

This setup and configuration will work in most cases, but it violates the IEEE 802.1W standard when (R/M)STP is used. If this is the only device in your Layer2 domain, then this should not cause problems, but problems can arise when there are other vendor switches. The reason for this is that RSTP on a bridge interface is enabled by default, allowing Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to be sent from each bridge port. While ether2 transmits BPDUs correctly without tagging, VLAN99 interface, being a bridge port, sends tagged BPDUs over ether1. Not all switches can understand tagged BPDUs.  Precautions should be made with this configuration in a more complex network where there are multiple network topologies for certain (group of) VLANs, this is relevant to MSTP and PVSTP(+) with mixed vendor devices. In a ring-like topology with multiple network topologies for certain VLANs, one port from the switch will be blocked, but in MSTP and PVSTP(+) a path can be opened for a certain VLAN, in such a situation it is possible that devices that don't support PVSTP(+) will untag the BPDUs and forward the BPDU, as a result, the switch will receive its own packet, trigger a loop detection and block a port, this can happen to other protocols as well, but (R)STP is the most common case. If a switch is using a BPDU guard function, then this type of configuration can trigger it and cause a port to be blocked by STP. It has been reported that this type of configuration can prevent traffic from being forwarded over certain bridge ports over time when using 6.41 or later. This type of configuration does not only break (R/M)STP, but it can cause loop warnings, this can be caused by MNDP packets or any other packets that are directly sent out from an interface.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Port blocked by RSTP
    Loops in network
    Port flapping
    Traffic stops forwarding over time
    BPDUs ignored by other RSTP enabled devices

Solution

To avoid compatibility issues you should use bridge VLAN filtering. Below you can find an example of how the same traffic tagging effect can be achieved with a bridge VLAN filtering configuration:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 pvid=99
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=99


By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you set up a Management port.
Bridged VLAN on physical interfaces

A very similar case to VLAN on a bridge in a bridge, consider the following scenario, you have a couple of switches in your network and you are using VLANs to isolate certain Layer2 domains and connect these switches to a router that assigns addresses and routes the traffic to the world. For redundancy, you connect all switches directly to the router and have enabled RSTP, but to be able to setup DHCP Server you decide that you can create a VLAN interface for each VLAN on each physical interface that is connected to a switch and add these VLAN interfaces in a bridge. A network diagram can be found below:

Configuration

Only the router part is relevant to this case, switch configuration doesn't really matter as long as ports are switched. Router configuration can be found below:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge10
add name=bridge20
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=ether1_v10 vlan-id=10
add interface=ether1 name=ether1_v20 vlan-id=20
add interface=ether2 name=ether2_v10 vlan-id=10
add interface=ether2 name=ether2_v20 vlan-id=20
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge10 interface=ether1_v10
add bridge=bridge10 interface=ether2_v10
add bridge=bridge20 interface=ether1_v20
add bridge=bridge20 interface=ether2_v20
Problem

You might notice that the network is having some weird delays or even the network is unresponsive, you might notice that there is a loop detected (packet received with own MAC address) and some traffic is being generated out of nowhere. The problem occurs because a broadcast packet that is coming from either one of the VLAN interface created on the Router will be sent out the physical interface, packet will be forwarded through the physical interface, through a switch and will be received back on a different physical interface, in this case, broadcast packets sent out ether1_v10 will be received on ether2, packet will be captured by ether2_v10, which is bridged with ether1_v10 and will get forwarded again the same path (loop). (R)STP might not always detect this loop since (R)STP is not aware of any VLANs, a loop does not exist with untagged traffic, but exists with tagged traffic. In this scenario, it is quite obvious to spot the loop, but in more complex setups it is not always easy to detect the network design flaw. Sometimes this network design flaw might get unnoticed for a very long time if your network does not use broadcast traffic, usually, Neighbor Discovery Protocol is broadcasting packets from the VLAN interface and will usually trigger a loop detection in such a setup. Sometimes it is useful to capture the packet that triggered a loop detection, this can by using sniffer and analyzing the packet capture file:
/tool sniffer
set filter-mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:44/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF \
filter-interface=ether1 filter-direction=rx file-name=loop_packet.pcap

Or a more convenient way using logging:
/interface bridge filter
add action=log chain=forward src-mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:44/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
add action=log chain=input src-mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:44/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Port blocked by (R)STP;
    Loops in network;
    Low throughput;
    Port flapping;
    Network inaccessible;

Solution

A solution is to use bridge VLAN filtering in order to make all bridges compatible with IEEE 802.1W and IEEE 802.1Q.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,ether2,bridge vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,ether2,bridge vlan-ids=20
/interface vlan
add name=vlan10 interface=bridge vlan-id=10
add name=vlan20 interface=bridge vlan-id=20


By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you set up a Management port.
Bridged VLAN

A more simplified scenario of Bridged VLAN on physical interfaces, but in this case, you simply want to bridge two or more VLANs together that are created on different physical interfaces. This is a very common type of setup that deserves a separate article since misconfiguring this type of setup has caused multiple network failures. This type of setup is also used for VLAN translation.
Configuration
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=ether1_v10 vlan-id=10
add interface=ether2 name=ether2_v10 vlan-id=10
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1_v10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2_v10

Problem

You may notice that certain parts of the network are not accessible and/or certain links keep flapping. This is due to (R)STP, this type of configuration forces the device to send out tagged BPDUs, that might not be supported by other devices, including RouterOS. Since a device receives a malformed packet (tagged BPDUs should not exist in your network when running (R)STP, this violates IEEE 802.1W and IEEE 802.1Q), the device will not interpret the packet correctly and can have unexpected behavior.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Port blocked by (R)STP;
    Port flapping;
    Network inaccessible;

Solution

The easiest solution is to simply disable (R)STP on the bridge:
/interface bridge
set bridge1 protocol-mode=none


though it is still recommended to rewrite your configuration to use bridge VLAN filtering:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1,ether2 vlan-ids=10


By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you set up a Management port.
Bridge VLAN filtering on non-CRS3xx

Consider the following scenario, you found out the new bridge VLAN filtering feature and you decided to change the configuration on your device, you have a very simple trunk/access port setup and you like the concept of bridge VLAN filtering.
Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=40
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=30
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether4 vlan-ids=40
Problem

For example, you use this configuration on a CRS1xx/CRS2xx series device and you started to notice that the CPU usage is very high and when running a performance test to check the network's throughput you notice that the total throughput is only a fraction of the wire-speed performance that it should easily reach. The cause of the problem is that not all devices support bridge VLAN filtering on a hardware level. All devices are able to be configured with bridge VLAN filtering, but only a few of them will be able to offload the traffic to the switch chip. If an improper configuration method is used on a device with a built-in switch chip, then the CPU will be used to forward the traffic.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Missing "H" flag on bridge ports
    Low throughput
    High CPU usage

Solution

Before using bridge VLAN filtering check if your device supports it at the hardware level, a table with compatibility can be found at the Bridge Hardware Offloading section. Each type of device currently requires a different configuration method, below is a list of which configuration should be used on a device in order to use the benefits of hardware offloading:

    CRS3xx series devices
    CRS1xx/CRS2xx series devices
    Other devices with a switch chip

VLAN filtering with multiple switch chips

Consider the following scenario, you have a device with two or more switch chips and you have decided to use a single bridge and set up VLAN filtering (by using the /interface ethernet switch menu) on a hardware level to be able to reach wire-speed performance on your network. This is very relevant for RB2011 and RB3011 series devices. In this example, let's assume that you want to have a single trunk port and all other ports are access ports, for example, ether10 is our trunk port and ether1-ether9 are our access ports.
Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether9
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether10
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN10 vlan-id=10
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5,ether6,ether7,ether8,ether9 default-vlan-id=10 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set ether10 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu,switch2-cpu vlan-mode=secure
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=10
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8,ether9,ether10,switch2-cpu switch=switch2 vlan-id=10
Problem

After running a few tests you might notice that packets from ether6-ether10 are forwarded as expected, but packets from ether1-ether5 are not always forwarded correctly (especially through the trunk port). The most noticeable issue would be that packets from ether1-ether5 through ether10 are simply dropped, this is because these ports are located on different switch chip, this means that VLAN filtering is not possible on a hardware level since the switch chip is not aware of the VLAN table's contents on a different switch chip. Packets that are being forwarded between ports that are located on different switch chips are also processed by the CPU, which means you won't be able to achieve wire-speed performance.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Packets being dropped;
    Low throughput;

Solution

The proper solution is to take into account this hardware design and plan your network topology accordingly. To solve this issue you must create two separate bridges and configure VLAN filtering on each switch chip, this limits the possibility to forward packets between switch chip, though it is possible to configure routing between both bridges (if devices that are connected on each switch chip are using different network subnets).

There is a way to configure the device to have all ports switch together and yet be able to use VLAN filtering on a hardware level, though this solution has some caveats. The idea is to sacrifice a single Ethernet port on each switch chip that will act as a trunk port to forward packets between switch chip, this can be done by plugging an Ethernet cable between both switch chip, for example, lets plug in an Ethernet cable between ether5 and ether6 then reconfigure your device assuming that these ports are trunk ports:
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether6
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether7
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether8
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether9
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether10
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether7,ether8,ether9 default-vlan-id=10 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set ether5,ether6,ether10 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure default-vlan-id=auto
set switch1-cpu,switch2-cpu vlan-mode=secure
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=10
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8,ether9,ether10,switch2-cpu switch=switch2 vlan-id=10


For 100Mbps switch chips, use default-vlan-id=0 instead of default-vlan-id=auto
VLAN filtering with simplified bridge VLAN table

This issue has been resolved since RouterOS v7.15. Dynamic VLANs are now always created as separate entries and no longer merge with statically configured ones.

You need to create a network setup where multiple clients are connected to separate access ports and isolated by different VLANs, this traffic should be tagged and sent to the appropriate trunk port. Access ports are configured using a pvid property. As the trunk port is used on both VLANs, you decided to simplify configuration by adding a single bridge VLAN table entry and separate VLANs by a comma. This is especially useful when tagged trunk ports are used across large numbers of VLANs or even certain VLAN ranges (e.g. vlan-id=100-200). See a network diagram and configuration below.

Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=20
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=10,20
Problem

Traffic is correctly forwarded and tagged from access ports to trunk port, but you might notice that some broadcast or multicast packets are actually flooded between both untagged access ports, although they should be on different VLANs. Furthermore, broadcast and multicast traffic from the tagged port is also flooded to both access ports. This might raise some security concerns as traffic from different networks can be sniffed. When you look at the bridge VLAN table, you notice that a single entry has been created for VLANs 10 and 20, and both untagged ports are part of the same VLAN group.
[admin@SW1] /interface bridge vlan print where tagged=ether2
Columns: BRIDGE, VLAN-IDS, CURRENT-TAGGED, CURRENT-UNTAGGED
# BRIDGE   VLAN-IDS  CURRENT-TAGGED  CURRENT-UNTAGGED
;;; port with pvid added to untagged group which might cause problems, consider adding a separate VLAN entry
0 bridge1        10  ether2          ether3          
                 20                  ether4     
Symptoms

    Traffic is flooded between different VLANs
    Red warning: port with pvid added to untagged group which might cause problems, consider adding a separate VLAN entry

Solution 

When access ports have been configured using the pvid property, they get dynamically added to the appropriate VLAN entry. After creating a static VLAN entry with multiple VLANs or VLAN range, the untagged access port with a matching pvid also gets included in the same VLAN group or range. It might be useful to define a large number of VLANs using a single configuration line, but extra caution should be taken when access ports are configured. For this example, separate VLAN entries should be created:
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 untagged=ether4 vlan-ids=20
MTU on the master interface

Consider the following scenario, you have created a bridge, added a few interfaces to it and have created a VLAN interface on top of the bridge interface, but you need to increase the MTU size on the VLAN interface in order to receive larger packets.
Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN99 vlan-id=99
Problem

As soon as you try to increase the MTU size on the VLAN interface, you receive an error that RouterOS Could not set MTU. This can happen when you are trying to set MTU larger than the L2MTU. In this case, you need to increase the L2MTU size on all slave interfaces, which will update the L2MTU size on the bridge interface. After this has been done, you will be able to set a larger MTU on the VLAN interface. The same principle applies to bond interfaces. You can increase the MTU on interfaces like VLAN, MPLS, VPLS, Bonding and other interfaces only when all physical slave interfaces have proper L2MTU set.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Cannot change MTU

Solution

Increase the L2MTU on slave interfaces before changing the MTU on a master interface.
/interface ethernet
set ether1,ether2 l2mtu=9018
/interface vlan
set VLAN99 mtu=9000
MTU inconsistency

Consider the following scenario, you have multiple devices in your network, most of them are used as a switch/bridge in your network and there are certain endpoints that are supposed to receive and process traffic. To decrease the overhead in your network, you have decided to increase the MTU size so you set a larger MTU size on both endpoints, but you start to notice that some packets are being dropped.

Configuration

In this case, both endpoints can be any type of device, we will assume that they are both Linux servers that are supposed to transfer a large amount of data. In such a scenario, you would have probably set interface MTU to 9000 on ServerA and ServerB and on your Switch you have probably have set something similar to this:
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1
Problem

This is a very simple problem, but in larger networks, it can be hard to detect. For instance, ping might be working since a generic ping packet will be 70 bytes long (14 bytes for Ethernet header, 20 bytes for IPv4 header, 8 bytes for ICMP header, 28 bytes for ICMP payload), but data transfer might not work properly. The reason why some packets might not get forwarded is that MikroTik devices running RouterOS by default have MTU set to 1500 and L2MTU set to something around 1580 bytes (depends on the device), but the Ethernet interface will silently drop anything that does not fit into the L2MTU size. Note that the L2MTU parameter is not relevant to x86 or CHR devices. For a device that is only supposed to forward packets, there is no need to increase the MTU size, it is only required to increase the L2MTU size, RouterOS will not allow you to increase the MTU size that is larger than the L2MTU size. If you require the packet to be received on the interface and the device needs to process this packet rather than just forwarding it, for example, in the case of routing, then it is required to increase the L2MTU and the MTU size, but you can leave the MTU size on the interface to the default value if you are using only IP traffic (that supports packet fragmentation) and don't mind that packets are being fragmented. You can use the ping utility to make sure that all devices are able to forward jumbo frames:
/ping 192.168.88.1 size=9000 do-not-fragment

Remember that the L2MTU and MTU size needs to be larger or equal to the ping packet size on the device from which and to which you are sending a ping packet since ping (ICMP) is IP traffic that is sent out from an interface over Layer3.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Web pages are not able to load up, but ping works properly;
    Tunnels dropping traffic;
    Specific protocols are broken;
    Large packet loss;

Solution

Increase the L2MTU size on your Switch:
/interface ethernet
set ether1,ether2 l2mtu=9000

In case your traffic is encapsulated (VLAN, VPN, MPLS, VPLS, or other), then you might need to consider setting an even larger L2MTU size. In this scenario, it is not needed to increase the MTU size for the reason described above.

Full frame MTU is not the same as L2MTU. L2MTU size does not include the Ethernet header (14 bytes) and the CRC checksum (FCS) field. The FCS field is stripped by the Ethernet's driver and RouterOS will never show the extra 4 bytes to any packet. For example, if you set MTU and L2MTU to 9000, then the full-frame MTU is 9014 bytes long, this can also be observed when sniffing packets with "/tool sniffer quick" command.
Bridge and reserved MAC addresses

Consider the following scenario, you want to transparently bridge two network segments together, either those are tunnel interfaces like EoIP, Wireless interfaces, Ethernet interface, or any other kind of interfaces that can be added to a bridge. Such a setup allows you to seamlessly connect two devices together like there was only a physical cable between them, this is sometimes called a transparent bridge from DeviceA to DeviceB.
Configuration

For both devices DeviceA and DeviceB there should be a very similar configuration.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 protocol-mode=rstp
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
add interface=eoip1 bridge=bridge1
Problem

Both devices are able to communicate with each other, but some protocols do not work properly. The reason is that as soon as you use any STP variant (STP, RSTP, MSTP), you make the bridge compliant with IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q, these standards recommend that packets that are destined to 01:80:C2:00:00:0X should NOT be forwarded. In cases where there are only 2 ports added to a bridge (R/M)STP should not be used since a loop cannot occur from 2 interfaces and if a loop does occur, the cause is elsewhere and should be fixed on a different bridge. Since (R/M)STP is not needed in transparent bridge setups, it can be disabled. As soon as (R/M)STP is disabled, the RouterOS bridge is not compliant with IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q and therefore will forward packets that are destined to 01:80:C2:00:00:0X.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    LLDP neighbors not showing up;
    802.1x authentication (dot1x) not working;
    LACP interface not passing traffic;

Solution

It is possible to partly disable compliance with IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q, this can be done by changing the bridge protocol mode.
/interface bridge
set bridge1 protocol-mode=none

The IEEE 802.1x standard is meant to be used between a switch and a client directly. If it is possible to connect a device between the switch and the client, then this creates a security threat. For this reason, it is not recommended to disable the compliance with IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q, but rather design a proper network topology.
Bonding between Wireless links

Consider the following scenario, you have set up multiple Wireless links and to achieve maximum throughput and yet to achieve redundancy you have decided to place Ethernet interfaces into a bond and depending on the traffic that is being forwarded you have chosen a certain bonding mode. This scenario can be applied to any case, where a bonding interface is created between links, that are not directly connected to each other.

Configuration

The following configuration is relevant to R1 and R2:
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=ether1,ether2 transmit-hash-policy=layer-2-and-3
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.X/24 interface=bond1

While the following configuration is relevant to AP1, AP2, ST1, and ST2, where X corresponds to an IP address for each device.
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 protocol-mode=none
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
add interface=wlan1 bridge=bridge1
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.X/24 interface=bridge1
Problem

While traffic is being forwarded properly between R1 and R2, load balancing, link failover is working properly as well, but devices between R1 and R2 are not always accessible or some of them are completely inaccessible (in most cases AP2 and ST2 are inaccessible). After examining the problem you might notice that packets do not always get forwarded over the required bonding slave and as a result, never is received by the device you are trying to access. This is a network design and bonding protocol limitation. As soon as a packet needs to be sent out through a bonding interface (in this case you might be trying to send ICMP packets to AP2 or ST2), the bonding interface will create a hash based on the selected bonding mode and transmit-hash-policy and will select an interface, through which to send the packet out, regardless of the destination is only reachable through a certain interface. Some devices will be accessible because the generated hash matches the interface, on which the device is located on, but it might not choose the needed interface as well, which will result in inaccessible device. Only broadcast bonding mode does not have this kind of protocol limitation, but this bonding mode has a very limited use case.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Limited connectivity
    Unstable links (in case of balance-rr)

Solution

Bonding interfaces are not supposed to be connected using in-direct links, but it is still possible to create a workaround. The idea behind this workaround is to find a way to bypass packets being sent out using the bonding interface. There are multiple ways to force a packet not to be sent out using the bonding interface, but essentially the solution is to create new interfaces on top of physical interfaces and add these newly created interfaces to a bond instead of the physical interfaces. One way to achieve this is to create EoIP tunnels on each physical interface, but that creates a huge overhead and will reduce overall throughput. You should create a VLAN interface on top of each physical interface instead, this creates a much smaller overhead and will not impact overall performance noticeably. Here is an example of how R1 and R2 should be reconfigured:
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=VLAN_ether1 vlan-id=999
add interface=ether2 name=VLAN_ether2 vlan-id=999
/interface bonding
add mode=balance-xor name=bond1 slaves=VLAN_ether1,VLAN_ether2 transmit-hash-policy=layer-2-and-3
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.X/24 interface=bond1
add address=192.168.11.X/24 interface=ether1
add address=192.168.22.X/24 interface=ether2

AP1 and ST1 only need updated IP addresses to the correct subnet:
/ip address
add address=192.168.11.X/24 interface=bridge1

Same changes must be applied to AP2 and ST2 (make sure to use the correct subnet):
/ip address
add address=192.168.22.X/24 interface=bridge1

With this approach, you create the least overhead and the least configuration changes are required.

LACP (802.3ad) is not mean to be used in setups, where devices bonding slaves are not directly connected, in this case, it is not recommended to use LACP if there are Wireless links between both routers. LACP requires both bonding slaves to be at the same link speeds, Wireless links can change their rates at any time, which will decrease overall performance and stability. Other bonding modes should be used instead.
Bandwidth testing

Consider the following scenario, you set up a link between two devices, this can be any link, an Ethernet cable, a wireless link, a tunnel or any other connection. You decide that you want to test the link's bandwidth, but for convenience reasons, you decide to start testing the link with the same devices that are running the link.

Problem

As soon as you start Bandwidth test or Traffic generator you notice that the throughput is much smaller than expected. For very powerful routers, which should be able to forward many Gigabits per second (Gbps) you notice that only a few Gigabits per second gets forwarded. The reason why this is happening is because of the testing method you are using, you should never test throughput on a router while using the same router for generating traffic because you are adding an additional load on the CPU that reduces the total throughput.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Low throughput;
    High CPU usage;

Solution

Use a proper testing method. Don't use Bandwidth-test to test large capacity links and don't run any tool that generates traffic on the same device you are testing. Design your network properly so you can attach devices that will generate and receive traffic on both ends. If you are familiar with Iperf, then this concept should be clear. Remember that in real-world a router or a switch does not generate large amounts of traffic (at least it shouldn't, otherwise, it might indicate an existing security issue), a server/client generates the traffic while a router/switch forwards the traffic (and does some manipulations to the traffic in appropriate cases).

Bridge split-horizon usage

Consider the following scenario, you have a bridge and you need to isolate certain bridge ports from each other. There are options to use a built-in switch chip to isolate certain ports on certain switch chips, you can use bridge firewall rules to prevent certain ports to be able to send any traffic to other ports, you can isolate ports in a PVLAN type of setup using port isolation, but there is also a software-based solution to use bridge split-horizon (which disables hardware offloading on all switch chips).
Configuration
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=1 hw=no interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=2 hw=no interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=3 hw=no interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=4 hw=no interface=ether4
Problem

After setting the bridge split-horizon on each port, you start to notice that each port is still able to send data between each other. The reason for this is the misuse of bridge split-horizon. A bridge port is only not able to communicate with ports that are in the same horizon, for example, horizon=1 is not able to communicate with horizon=1, but is able to communicate with horizon=2, horizon=3, and so on.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    Traffic is being forwarded on different bridge split-horizons

Solution

Set a proper value as the bridge split-horizon. In case you want to isolate each port from each other (a common scenario for PPPoE setups) and each port is only able to communicate with the bridge itself, then all ports must be in the same bridge split-horizon.
/interface bridge port
set [f] horizon=1


Setting all bridge ports in the same bridge split-horizon will result in traffic being only able to reach the bridge interface itself, then packets can only be routed. This is useful when you want other devices to filter out certain traffic. Similar behavior can be achieved using bridge filter rules.
Unsupported SFP modules

Consider the following scenario, you have decided to use optical fiber cables to connect your devices together by using SFP or SFP+ optical modules, but for convenience reasons, you have decided to use SFP optical modules that were available.
Problem

As soon as you configure your devices to have connectivity on the ports that are using these SFP optical modules, you might notice that either the link is working properly or experiencing random connectivity issues. There are many vendors that manufacture SFP optical modules, but not all vendors strictly follow SFP MSA, SFF, and IEEE 802.3 standards, which can lead to unpredictable compatibility issues, which is a very common issue when using not well known or unsupported SFP optical modules in MikroTik devices.
Symptoms

Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:

    SFP interface does not link up
    Random packet drop
    Unstable link (flapping)
    SFP module not running after a reboot
    SFP module not running after power-cycle
    SFP module running only on one side

Solution
You should only use supported SFP modules. Always check the SFP compatibility table if you are intending to use SFP modules manufactured by MikroTik. There are other SFP modules that do work with MikroTik devices as well, check the Supported peripherals table to find other SFP modules that have been confirmed to work with MikroTik devices. Some unsupported modules might not be working properly at certain speeds and with auto-negotiation, you might want to try to disable it and manually set a link speed.
