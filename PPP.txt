Overview

The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP in RouterOS is based on RFC 1661 standard.
Introduction

The basic purpose of PPP at this point is to transport Layer-3 packets across a Data Link layer point-to-point link.  Packets between both peers are assumed to deliver in order. 

PPP is comprised of three main components:

     A method for encapsulating multi-protocol datagrams.
     A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring, and testing the data-link connection. 
    A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols.

Detailed PPP packet processing in RouterOS you can see in the Packet Flow Diagram.
PPP Client
/interface ppp-client
PPP Client example

This is an example of how to add a client using an exposed serial port from an LTE modem.
/interface ppp-client add apn=yourapn dial-on-demand=no disabled=no port=usb2

The dial-on-demand should to be set to 'no' for a continuous connection.
PPP Server
/interface ppp-server
